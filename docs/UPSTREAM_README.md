---

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Option 1: npx (supported hosts)

Install Scientific Agent Skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
```

This is a common standards-based installer for supported Agent Skills hosts, including current versions of **Claude Code**, **Claude Cowork**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **Google Antigravity**, and **Cursor**. Confirm installation paths and optional metadata behavior in your host's current documentation.

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (`gh skill`)

If you use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (v2.90.0+), you can install skills with [`gh skill`](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-04-16-manage-agent-skills-with-github-cli/):

```bash
# Browse and install interactively
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills

# Install a specific skill directly
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills scanpy

# Target a specific agent host
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent cursor
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent claude-code
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent codex
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent gemini
```

`gh skill` automatically installs to the correct directory for your agent host and records provenance metadata for supply chain integrity.

#### Version pinning

Pin to a specific release tag or commit SHA for reproducible installs:

```bash
# Pin to a release tag
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --pin v2.63.0

# Pin to a commit SHA
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --pin abc123def
```

#### Keeping skills up to date

```bash
# Check for updates interactively
gh skill update

# Update all installed skills
gh skill update --all
```

### Option 3: Agent Plugins (Cursor, Codex, and other plugin clients)

This repository is a valid [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/) 1.0.0 package: root [`plugin.json`](plugin.json) plus Agent Skills under `skills/`. Clients that support the standard discover every immediate child of `skills/` that contains a `SKILL.md`.

**Cursor** — symlink or copy the repo into the local plugins directory, then reload:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.cursor/plugins/local/scientific-agent-skills
```

Restart Cursor or run **Developer: Reload Window**, then confirm the plugin and its skills appear under **Customize**. See [Cursor plugins](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins).

**Codex** — install from a local checkout (confirm the current CLI flag names in Codex docs):

```bash
codex plugins install .
```

Compatible clients (Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, Kiro, and others listed at [agent-plugins.org](https://agent-plugins.org/compatible-clients)) share the same package layout; installation UX stays client-specific.

### Other Agent Skills hosts (OpenClaw, NemoClaw, Pi, Hermes, …)

Agent hosts differ in install paths, discovery settings, and support for optional frontmatter fields. `npx skills add` (Option 1) commonly installs into the `~/.agents/skills/` convention, with project-scoped installs under `.agents/skills/`; confirm both paths against your host's current documentation. To install manually on a host configured to scan one of those locations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills.git ~/.agents/skills/scientific-agent-skills   # user-level
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills.git .agents/skills/scientific-agent-skills      # project-level
```

For Hermes versions that support skill taps, add the repository as a tap:

```bash
hermes skills tap add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
```

Every `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter, but legacy and community skills vary in `metadata` formatting (block or flow style) and optional extension fields. Repository updates must keep `metadata.version` as a quoted numeric string and pass canonical `skills-ref validate ./skills/<skill-name>` checks. Hosts may interpret optional metadata and credential prompts differently, so verify behavior on the target host. Because 161 skills add up to a lot of standing context, consider installing a topical subset rather than the whole collection.

> **NemoClaw note:** NemoClaw runs agents inside NVIDIA OpenShell with default-deny outbound networking. Skills are discovered and loaded normally, but any skill that needs the network — package installs via `uv`, or API calls (Exa, Parallel, Benchling, NCBI, Materials Project, …) — only works once the operator pre-approves the relevant domains in the OpenShell TUI.

**That's it!** A compatible host can discover the skills from its configured paths and use them when relevant. You can also invoke any skill manually by mentioning the skill name in your prompt.

---

## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

> **Skills can execute code and influence your coding agent's behavior. Review what you install.**

Agent Skills are powerful — they can instruct your AI agent to run arbitrary code, install packages, make network requests, and modify files on your system. A malicious or poorly written skill has the potential to steer your coding agent into harmful behavior.

We take security seriously. All contributions go through a review process, and we run LLM-based security scans (via [Cisco AI Defense Skill Scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner)) on every skill in this repository. However, as a small team with a growing number of community contributions, we cannot guarantee that every skill has been exhaustively reviewed for all possible risks.

**It is ultimately your responsibility to review the skills you install and decide which ones to trust.**

We recommend the following:

- **Do not install everything at once.** Only install the skills you actually need for your work. While installing the full collection was reasonable when K-Dense created and maintained every skill, the repository now includes many community contributions that we may not have reviewed as thoroughly.
- **Read the `SKILL.md` before installing.** Each skill's documentation describes what it does, what packages it uses, and what external services it connects to. If something looks suspicious, don't install it.
- **Check the contribution history.** Skills authored by K-Dense (`K-Dense-AI`) have been through our internal review process. Community-contributed skills have been reviewed to the best of our ability, but with limited resources.
- **Run the security scanner yourself.** Before installing third-party skills, scan them locally:
  ```bash
  uv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner
  skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral
  ```
- **Report anything suspicious.** If you find a skill that looks malicious or behaves unexpectedly, please [open an issue](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/issues) immediately so we can investigate.

Skills are scanned weekly — incrementally, so unchanged skills carry their previous findings forward, with a full rescan of everything at least every 30 days and whenever the scanner or model changes — and the results are published to [docs/security-report.md](docs/security-report.md). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy, what is in scope, how to report a vulnerability privately, and how to contest a scan finding. We try to address security gaps as they arise.

## 📝 From the Blog

Deep dives, benchmarks, and guides from the [K-Dense blog](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog) that are directly relevant to using the skills in this repository.

### Start here

- **[Agent Skills: The Final Piece for AI-Powered Scientific Research](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/agent-skills-final-piece-for-ai-powered-research)** — What Agent Skills are, why curated domain guidance beats raw model capability, and an introduction to this repository.
- **[K-Dense Web vs Scientific Agent Skills: Why We Built Both (And Which One You Should Use)](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/k-dense-web-vs-scientific-agent-skills)** — When the open-source skills are the right tool, and when a hosted platform with managed compute makes more sense.

### Skill benchmarks and deep dives

- **[One Skill, 78 Databases: Why We Didn't Build 78 Skills](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/database-lookup-one-skill-78-databases)** — The design rationale behind [database-lookup](skills/database-lookup/): consolidation cut always-on context cost by 13.9x while holding routing accuracy across five models.
- **[Can an AI Agent Run Your Mass Spec Pipeline? Benchmarking the PyOpenMS Skill](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/benchmarking-pyopenms-skill-mass-spectrometry)** — A 250-run study of [pyopenms](skills/pyopenms/): 100% task success with the skill versus 96% without, 92% fewer pyOpenMS API errors, and 10% lower cost.
- **[Beyond RDKit: Benchmarking the Rowan Agent Skill Against Experiment](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/benchmarking-rowan-skill-chemistry)** — [rowan](skills/rowan/) compared against RDKit and experimental data: pKa MAE 0.23 (R² 0.986), logD₇.₄ MAE 1.15, and 0.19 Å RMSD docking pose recovery for roughly $0.52 of compute.
- **[GPU-Accelerate Your Science: 58x Average Speedup with a Single Skill](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/optimize-for-gpu-skill)** — [optimize-for-gpu](skills/optimize-for-gpu/) rewriting CPU-bound Python across 12 libraries, with speedups ranging from 1.7x to 492x.
- **[Towards Smarter Scientific Search: Exa Joins the Scientific Agent Skills Library](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/towards-smarter-scientific-search-exa-scientific-agent-skills)** — What [exa-search](skills/exa-search/) adds: neural semantic search and URL extraction tuned for scholarly discovery instead of keyword matching.
- **[Benchmarking Nano Banana 2 Lite for Scientific Image Generation](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/benchmarking-nano-banana-2-lite-scientific-image-model)** — A 240-image comparison of scientific-diagram models, useful when choosing a backend for [generate-image](skills/generate-image/): 3.8 s median latency for Nano Banana 2 Lite against 49 s for GPT Image 2, with a quality tradeoff.
- **[Benchmarking NVIDIA BioNeMo Agent Toolkit Skills for NIM microservices](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/benchmarking-nvidia-bionemo-nim-skill)** — A separate NVIDIA skill set rather than one of these, but the findings generalize: skills help most with routing to non-obvious endpoints and with weak-model reliability, and do not improve the underlying scientific model's accuracy.

### Security and safe deployment

- **[Security in the Science Agent Era: What Every Lab Needs to Know Before Installing Skills](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/skill-security-before-you-install)** — The practical review checklist behind this repo's [Security Disclaimer](#%EF%B8%8F-security-disclaimer): read the full `SKILL.md` and `scripts/`, scan before installing, and pin versions instead of tracking a branch.
- **[The Sandboxed AI Scientist: Pairing NVIDIA OpenShell with Scientific Agent Skills](https://www.k-dense.ai/blog/sandboxed-ai-scientist-openshell-skills)** — Running these skills inside a policy-governed sandbox; see also the NemoClaw note in [Getting Started](#-getting-started).

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to expand and improve this scientific skills repository!

For detailed instructions on adding or updating a skill, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The guide covers repository structure, required `SKILL.md` frontmatter, Agent Skills specification requirements, versioning, validation, security scanning, and pull request expectations.

### Ways to Contribute

✨ **Add New Skills**
- Create skills for additional scientific packages or databases
- Add integrations for scientific platforms and tools

📚 **Improve Existing Skills**
- Enhance documentation with more examples and use cases
- Add new workflows and reference materials
- Improve code examples and scripts
- Fix bugs or update outdated information

🐛 **Report Issues**
- Submit bug reports with detailed reproduction steps
- Suggest improvements or new features

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-skill`)
3. **Follow** [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the existing directory structure
4. **Ensure** all new skills include valid `SKILL.md` files with required frontmatter and `metadata.version`
5. **Test** your examples and workflows thoroughly, and add a suite under `tests/<skill-name>/` if your skill ships `scripts/`
6. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing skill'`)
7. **Push** to your branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-skill`)
8. **Submit** a pull request with a clear description of your changes

### Contribution Guidelines

✅ **Adhere to the [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)** — Every skill must follow the official spec (valid `SKILL.md` frontmatter, naming conventions, directory structure)  
✅ Include a quoted `metadata.version` value in every `SKILL.md`  
✅ Increment `metadata.version` when updating an existing skill  
✅ Maintain consistency with existing skill documentation format  
✅ Ensure all code examples are tested and functional  
✅ Follow scientific best practices in examples and workflows  
✅ Update relevant documentation when adding new capabilities  
✅ Provide clear comments and docstrings in code  
✅ Include references to official documentation

### Testing

Every skill that ships `scripts/` must have a test suite under `tests/<skill-name>/` and an entry in `tests/skill-requirements.toml`. This is enforced — `tests/_meta` fails a pull request that adds bundled tooling without one, and it also runs a repo-wide structural contract over all skills (frontmatter conformance, `SKILL.md` length, local links resolving, scripts parsing, no shipped bytecode, no hardcoded local paths, `--help` behavior).

```bash
# Structural contract and coverage guard — seconds, no scientific packages needed
uv run python -m pytest tests/_meta -q

# One skill's suite
uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/<skill-name> -q

# Every suite, each in its own throwaway environment
uv run python tests/run_all.py --isolated
```

The [Skill Tests](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/actions/workflows/skill-tests.yml) workflow runs the contract plus the standard-library-only suites on every pull request; the full `--isolated` sweep builds ~100 environments and is run locally or on a schedule.

### Security Scanning

All skills in this repository are security-scanned using [Cisco AI Defense Skill Scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner), an open-source tool that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns in Agent Skills.

If you are contributing a new skill, we recommend running the scanner locally before submitting a pull request:

```bash
uv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner
skill-scanner scan /path/to/your/skill --use-behavioral
```

> **Note:** A clean scan result reduces noise in review, but does not guarantee a skill is free of all risk. Contributed skills are also reviewed manually before merging.

### Recognition

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem: Skills not loading**
- Verify skill folders are in the correct directory (see [Getting Started](#-getting-started))
- Each skill folder must contain a `SKILL.md` file
- Restart your agent/IDE after copying skills
- In Cursor, check Settings → Rules to confirm skills are discovered

**Problem: Missing Python dependencies**
- Solution: Check the specific `SKILL.md` file for required packages
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install package-name`

**Problem: API rate limits**
- Solution: Many databases have rate limits. Review the specific database documentation
- Consider implementing caching or batch requests

**Problem: Authentication errors**
- Solution: Some services require API keys. Check the `SKILL.md` for authentication setup
- Verify your credentials and permissions

**Problem: Outdated examples**
- Solution: Report the issue via GitHub Issues
- Check the official package documentation for updated syntax

**Problem: `gh skill install` or docs link to `scientific-skills/` fails (v2.43.0+)**
- As of v2.43.0, skills live under `skills/` (not `scientific-skills/`) to match the Agent Skills layout expected by GitHub CLI
- Update manual copy paths, bookmarks, and citations from `scientific-skills/<name>` to `skills/<name>`
- Re-run `gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills` after pulling the latest release

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this free to use?**  
A: Yes! This repository is MIT licensed. However, each individual skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file—be sure to review and comply with those terms.

**Q: Why are all skills grouped together instead of separate packages?**  
A: We believe good science in the age of AI is inherently interdisciplinary. Bundling all skills together makes it trivial for you (and your agent) to bridge across fields—e.g., combining genomics, cheminformatics, clinical data, and machine learning in one workflow—without worrying about which individual skills to install or wire together.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**  
A: The repository itself is MIT licensed, which allows commercial use. However, individual skills may have different licenses—check the `license` field in each skill's `SKILL.md` file to ensure compliance with your intended use.

**Q: Do all skills have the same license?**  
A: No. Each skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file. These licenses may differ from the repository's MIT License. Users are responsible for reviewing and adhering to the license terms of each individual skill they use.

**Q: How often is this updated?**  
A: We regularly update skills to reflect the latest versions of packages and APIs. Major updates are announced in release notes.

**Q: Can I use this with other AI models?**  
A: The core `SKILL.md` format follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard. Installation paths, discovery, and optional metadata support vary by host and version, so confirm your target host's current documentation.
