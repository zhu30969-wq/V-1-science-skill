# Database Selection Guide

Which database answers which question, grouped by domain: physics and astronomy, earth and
environmental sciences, chemistry and drugs, materials science and crystallography,
biology and genomics, disease and clinical, patents and regulatory, economics and finance,
social sciences and demographics, and cross-domain queries.

**Organism/species matters.** Most biology databases cover multiple organisms. If the user's query is about a specific organism, pass it explicitly — don't assume human. Common patterns: Ensembl uses `{species}` in the URL path (e.g. `homo_sapiens`), STRING/BioGRID/QuickGO use NCBI taxon IDs (`species=9606` for human, `10090` for mouse), UniProt uses `organism_id:9606` in search queries, KEGG uses organism codes (`hsa`, `mmu`). GTEx and Human Protein Atlas are human-only. Check the reference file for each database's specific parameter.

**Viral sequence retrieval is high risk.** For NCBI Virus-style requests with filters such as host, geography, collection dates, sequence length, completeness, ambiguous bases, segment, lab passage, source database, or protein annotation, prefer the `gget` skill's `gget virus` deterministic retrieval layer over hand-assembling browser or API workflows. If you must use SRA/ENA/NCBI APIs directly, document which filters were enforced server-side and which were validated locally, then reconcile final accession counts.

When the user's query spans multiple domains (e.g. "what do we know about aspirin" or "find everything about BRCA1"), rank sources by authority and start with the 2-3 databases most likely to answer the question. Add more databases only when the first pass leaves a specific gap. Keep at most 5 independent API requests in flight at once.
