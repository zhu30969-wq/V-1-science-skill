# Workflow Languages and Imports

## Choose a Workflow Path

| Source | DNAnexus path |
|---|---|
| Existing apps/applets assembled visually or by API | Native workflow |
| WDL draft-2, 1.0, or 1.1 | dxCompiler |
| CWL 1.2 | dxCompiler |
| Nextflow source folder/repository | `dx build --nextflow` |
| One Python/Bash program | Applet/app, not a workflow |

Keep the source workflow, compiler/importer version, container digests, input
JSON, and generated executable IDs together as provenance.

## Native Workflows

Native workflows connect app/applet stages. Build from a `dxworkflow.json`:

```bash
dx build --workflow "path/to/workflow-source" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/workflows/my-workflow"
```

Inspect inputs:

```bash
dx run "workflow-xxxx" -h
```

Run:

```bash
dx run "workflow-xxxx" \
  --input-json-file "inputs.json" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/runs/run-001" \
  --cost-limit 50
```

This returns an `analysis-...` ID. Each stage runs as a job or nested analysis.

Use native workflows when:

- Components already exist as maintained DNAnexus apps/applets.
- Users need UI-editable stage connections.
- The pipeline is small enough to maintain as a native workflow definition.

Promote stable inputs/outputs to workflow-level fields. Keep project-qualified
default links only when the referenced data is deliberately shared and
accessible in every intended context.

## WDL and CWL with dxCompiler

Current baseline: **dxCompiler 2.17.0**.

Supported language versions at that baseline:

- WDL draft-2
- WDL 1.0
- WDL 1.1
- CWL 1.2

WDL 2.0/development support is not production-ready. CWL 1.0 and 1.1 must be
upgraded to 1.2 before compilation.

### Setup

Prerequisites:

- Current `dx` toolkit and authenticated project context
- dxCompiler 2.17.0 JAR from the official GitHub release
- Java 8 or 11
- Docker only if using the documented containerized compiler workflow

Pin the JAR release and verify release checksums or provenance before use. Do
not use an unversioned download URL in production automation.

### Validate WDL

dxCompiler uses strict WDL parsing. Validate and lint with the matching
wdlTools release before compilation.

Then compile:

```bash
java -jar "dxCompiler-2.17.0.jar" compile \
  "workflow.wdl" \
  -project "project-xxxx" \
  -folder "/workflows" \
  -inputs "inputs.json"
```

The compile command can create a DNAnexus-formatted input JSON. Run the
compiled workflow with `dx run` and the generated input file:

```bash
dx run "workflow-xxxx" \
  --input-json-file "inputs.dx.json" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/runs/run-002" \
  --cost-limit 50
```

Run `java -jar dxCompiler-2.17.0.jar help` for the exact options supported by
that pinned release.

### Authenticated WDL imports

dxCompiler 2.17.0 supports per-domain bearer tokens for protected HTTP(S) WDL
imports through `DXCOMPILER_WDL_IMPORT_BEARER_TOKENS`.

This variable is highly sensitive:

- Inject only through a secret manager.
- Scope each token to the required import domain.
- Never print or log the variable.
- Never accept an arbitrary import host while credentials are active.
- Remove the variable after compilation.
- Do not embed it in workflow source, inputs, or extras.

Prefer immutable source references and checksum imported WDL dependencies.

### Prepare CWL

dxCompiler expects one packed CWL 1.2 document.

1. Upgrade older CWL to 1.2.
2. Pack imports into one compound document.
3. Validate with `cwltool --validate`.
4. Compile the packed file.

```bash
cwltool --validate "workflow.cwl.json"

java -jar "dxCompiler-2.17.0.jar" compile \
  "workflow.cwl.json" \
  -project "project-xxxx" \
  -folder "/workflows"
```

Pin `cwltool`, the upgrader/packer, and dxCompiler in reproducible
environments.

### Known constraints

Review the current dxCompiler README and release notes before migration. At the
documented baseline, relevant limitations include:

- WDL task/workflow names must be unique across the import tree.
- Some permissive type conversions accepted by other WDL engines are rejected.
- CWL 1.0/1.1 is not compiled directly.
- Calling native DNAnexus apps/applets from CWL through `dxni` is not supported.
- Some CWL requirements and global workflow publication remain unsupported.

Do not promise byte-identical behavior to Cromwell or another CWL runner
without conformance tests.

## Nextflow

Creating a DNAnexus app/applet from Nextflow source requires a DNAnexus license.
Current dx-toolkit supports Nextflow engine versions `25.10` and `24.10`;
`25.10` is the current default and `24.10` is retained only as an unmaintained
compatibility option.

### Repository import

```bash
dx build --nextflow \
  --repository "https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello" \
  --repository-tag "<pinned-tag-or-commit>" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/applets/hello"
```

Pin a repository tag or commit. Do not import a floating default branch for a
production pipeline.

For a private repository, `--git-credentials` accepts a DNAnexus file. Use a
short-lived, read-only credential and store it in a project whose membership
has been reviewed. Anyone with sufficient project access may be able to read
that file.

### Local source

```bash
dx build --nextflow "path/to/pipeline" \
  --nextflow-version "25.10" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/applets/my-pipeline"
```

An nf-core-style layout is encouraged but not required.

### Inspect and run

```bash
dx run "applet-xxxx" -h
```

The generated executable exposes fields for Nextflow run options,
configuration files, and a YAML/JSON parameter file. Use the generated help
rather than assuming field names.

```bash
dx run "applet-xxxx" \
  --input-json-file "nextflow-inputs.json" \
  --destination "project-xxxx:/runs/run-003" \
  --cost-limit 100
```

The execution is a head job supervising process subjobs. Monitor both:

```bash
dx watch "job-head"
dx watch "job-child"
dx find jobs --root-execution "job-head"
```

Check current CLI help if a filter name differs; dx-toolkit evolves.

### Containers

DNAnexus Nextflow execution supports Docker as the container runtime. Pin
containers by immutable digest.

Options include:

- Pulling from an approved registry
- `--cache-docker` to cache image tarballs in the selected project
- `--docker-secrets` for a DNAnexus file containing private registry
  credentials

Registry credentials are readable data objects to users with sufficient
project access. Use pull-only, short-lived credentials and review membership.

External image pulls require network access. Caching images improves
reproducibility and reduces registry dependence.

### Resume and cache

Nextflow pipeline applets support resume/cache-preservation inputs. Current
platform guidance limits preserved sessions in a project to 20. Clean old
work directories and cache sessions deliberately to control storage costs.

Only one job can resume and preserve the same session at a time. Do not launch
concurrent writes to one preserved session.

### Head job and process resources

The head job orchestrates the pipeline; process subjobs perform scientific
work. Size them separately:

- Choose a stable head-job instance that can manage the graph.
- Use Nextflow `cpus`, `memory`, and `disk` directives for processes.
- Confirm the generated executor maps requirements as expected.
- Keep queue size within platform limits (current documented maximum: 1000).

### Advanced work directory

DNAnexus documents using an S3 bucket as a Nextflow work directory through
OIDC. This requires a reviewed cloud trust policy and narrow bucket
permissions. Do not embed AWS credentials; use the DNAnexus job OIDC provider
and least-privilege IAM role.

## Portability Test Plan

For any imported workflow:

1. Validate source with its native tooling.
2. Pin compiler/importer and container versions.
3. Compile/import into a test project.
4. Run a small non-sensitive fixture.
5. Compare outputs and checksums to the reference runner.
6. Compare scatter behavior, retries, and resource mapping.
7. Test failed-task reporting and resume.
8. Confirm output locations and metadata.
9. Record execution cost and wall time.
10. Test in every intended cloud/region.

Scientific equivalence matters more than successful compilation. Validate
reference builds, coordinate systems, sort orders, floating-point tolerances,
and tool versions.

## Security Checklist

- No workflow source or inputs contain credentials.
- Imported URLs are trusted and immutable.
- Protected-import tokens are domain-scoped and not logged.
- Container images are pinned and provenance-checked.
- Private repository/registry files are in tightly controlled projects.
- Network access is limited to required hosts.
- External work-directory roles are least privilege.
- PHI does not leave approved projects/TREs.
- Cost limits, timeouts, and concurrency are bounded.
- Generated apps/applets are reviewed before publication.
