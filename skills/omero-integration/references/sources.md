# Official Sources and Version Snapshot

Research date: **2026-07-23**

This file records the authoritative basis for skill version 1.2. The snapshot
must not replace checking the target server's own version and discovery
endpoints.

## Current Versions

- **OMERO.server 5.6.18** — May 2026 bug-fix release.
- **OMERO.py / `omero-py` 5.22.1** — released 2026-03-25.
- **OMERO.web 5.31.0** — the version tested with OMERO.server 5.6.18.
- **Bio-Formats 8.5.0** — bundled by OMERO.server 5.6.18.
- **ZeroC IcePy 3.6.5** — exact client binding version in current official
  installation examples and OMERO-linked wheel matrix.

The OMERO.server history explicitly says 5.6.18 was tested with OMERO.py
5.22.1 and OMERO.web 5.31.0. That tested pairing is stronger evidence than
assuming compatibility from package version numbers.

  Basis for client installation and import/admin prerequisites.

## Connection and Security

- BlitzGateway documentation
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/PythonBlitzGateway.html
  Basis for context-manager closure, wrappers/lazy loading, stateless versus
  stateful service reuse, and stale stateful proxies after reconnection.

- Server security and firewalls
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/server-security.html
  Basis for login encryption, optional full transport encryption, session-ID
  exposure on insecure post-login traffic, and default router ports 4063/4064.

- Client/server SSL verification
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/client-server-ssl.html
  Basis for the warning that standard clients do not automatically verify the
  host and for the documented IceSSL verification properties.

  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/cli/sessions.html
  Basis for prompted login, session files, `omero sessions`, group switching,
  `-k` session reuse, and logout.

## Data, Metadata, ROIs, and Tables

- OMERO Python examples
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Python.html
  Primary current examples for bounded `getObjects`, annotations, pixels,
  rendering, tables, and ROI model operations.

- OMERO.tables
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Tables.html
  Basis for current column signatures, reads, queries, paging, global locking,
  and HDF implementation details.

- Structured annotations
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Model/StructuredAnnotations.html
  Basis for annotation type hierarchy, namespaces, and link semantics.

- OME ROI model 5.6.3
  https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.3/developers/roi.html
  Basis for the eight shape types, optional TheZ/TheT/TheC, RGBA fields, and
  union-of-2D-shapes representation. The page itself was last updated in 2018
  but documents the June 2016 schema still used by OMERO 5.6.

- Current generated `IRoi` API
  https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero-blitz/5.8.5/slice2html/omero/api/IRoi.html
  Basis for the explicit `IRoi` deprecation warning.

  OriginalFile, FileAnnotation, Image, and Fileset download forms. This was
  cross-checked against the official `ome/omero-py` package.

## OMERO.web and Public Data

- OMERO.web framework
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Web.html
  Basis for treating only `api` and `webgateway` as stable public APIs and
  treating other app URLs as internal.

- OMERO JSON API
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/json-api.html
  Basis for version discovery, API version headers, CSRF/login behavior,
  pagination/maxLimit, ROI endpoints, and limited create/update object types.

- Publishing data using OMERO.web
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/public.html
  Basis for dedicated read-only public groups/users, GET-only default, URL
  filters, and publication URL examples.

- OMERO configuration properties
  https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/config.html
  Basis for public-user defaults (`enabled=false`, `get_only=true`, and a
  URL filter that allows nothing until configured).

## Research Method

The refresh used focused `parallel-cli search` queries restricted primarily to:

- `omero.readthedocs.io`
- `docs.openmicroscopy.org`
- `ome-model.readthedocs.io`
- `openmicroscopy.org`
- `pypi.org`
- official `github.com/ome/*` repositories

Canonical pages above were then fetched with `parallel-cli extract` using
objectives specific to versions, Python/Ice compatibility, connection
security, BlitzGateway APIs, CLI behavior, tables, ROIs/annotations,
rendering, and OMERO.web/public APIs.

No Parallel JSON research artifacts were written into the repository.

## Known Documentation Tensions

- PyPI declares Python `>=3.10` without an upper bound, while the OMERO support
  matrix currently supports through 3.12 and marks 3.13/3.14 upcoming.
  Installation is also constrained by matching IcePy wheels. This skill uses
  Python 3.12 as the reproducible recommendation.
- Current Python docs still demonstrate `IRoi` while the generated API marks
  the interface deprecated. The skill documents and isolates this dependency
  rather than pretending a replacement is official.
- OMERO.web documents webclient publication links, while separately stating
  that webclient is not a stable public API. Durable publication links should
  use administrator-managed redirects/DOIs.
- `secure=True` encrypts traffic but standard clients do not automatically
  provide full hostname verification. High-assurance deployments need the
  administrator-provided IceSSL trust/name configuration.
