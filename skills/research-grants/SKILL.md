# Research Grant Writing

## Overview

Research grant writing is the process of developing competitive funding proposals for federal agencies and foundations. Master agency-specific requirements, review criteria, narrative structure, budget preparation, and compliance for NSF (National Science Foundation), NIH (National Institutes of Health), DOE (Department of Energy), DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and Taiwan's NSTC (National Science and Technology Council) submissions.

**Critical Principle: Grants are persuasive documents that must simultaneously demonstrate scientific rigor, innovation, feasibility, and broader impact.** Each agency has distinct priorities, review criteria, formatting requirements, and strategic goals that must be addressed.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Writing research proposals for NSF, NIH, DOE, DARPA, or NSTC programs
- Preparing project descriptions, specific aims, or technical narratives
- Developing broader impacts or significance statements
- Creating research timelines and milestone plans
- Preparing budget justifications and personnel allocation plans
- Responding to program solicitations or funding announcements
- Addressing reviewer comments in resubmissions
- Planning multi-institutional collaborative proposals
- Writing preliminary data or feasibility sections
- Preparing biosketches, CVs, or facilities descriptions

## Visual Enhancement (Optional)

Strong proposals often include 1–3 figures (timelines, workflow diagrams, preliminary data). Figures support review but are not a substitute for clear aims and methods.

**When figures help:**
- Research methodology and workflow diagrams
- Project timeline or Gantt charts
- Conceptual framework or system architecture (technical proposals)
- Experimental design flowcharts
- Broader impacts activity diagrams
- NSTC CM03 research architecture diagrams (often expected)

**How to create figures:**
- **Preferred:** Use the **scientific-schematics** skill (`--doc-type grant`) for AI-generated diagrams from a natural-language description
- **Alternative:** Build figures in your usual tools (matplotlib, Illustrator, PowerPoint, etc.)

From the `scientific-schematics` skill directory, with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set:

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "project timeline with Year 1-3 milestones" -o figures/timeline.png --doc-type grant
```

**Disclosure:** AI schematic generation sends your prompt to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) (a third-party API). Do not include unpublished sensitive details unless that transmission is appropriate for your project.

## Agency-Specific Overview

### NSF (National Science Foundation)
**Mission**: Promote the progress of science and advance national health, prosperity, and welfare

**Key Features**:

## Core Components of Research Proposals

Section-by-section guidance for every standard proposal component — specific aims,
significance, innovation, approach, preliminary data, timeline, budget and justification,
biosketch, facilities, data management and sharing, and broader impacts — with structure,
length targets, and worked language, is in
[references/core_components.md](references/core_components.md).

## Review Criteria, Writing Principles, and Proposal Types

- [references/review_criteria.md](references/review_criteria.md): how NIH, NSF, DOE, and
  DARPA score proposals, and what each criterion actually rewards.
- [references/writing_principles.md](references/writing_principles.md): what separates
  funded proposals from competent ones — framing, specificity, reviewer psychology, and
  readability.
- [references/proposal_types_and_resubmission.md](references/proposal_types_and_resubmission.md):
  the common proposal types and how to handle a resubmission, including responding to
  a summary statement.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Conceptual Mistakes

1. **Failing to Address Review Criteria**: Not explicitly discussing significance, innovation, approach, etc.
2. **Mismatch with Agency Mission**: Proposing research that doesn't align with agency goals
3. **Unclear Significance**: Failing to articulate why the research matters
4. **Insufficient Innovation**: Incremental work presented as transformative
5. **Vague Objectives**: Goals that are not specific or measurable

### Writing Mistakes

1. **Poor Organization**: Lack of clear structure and flow
2. **Excessive Jargon**: Inaccessible to broader review panel
3. **Verbosity**: Unnecessarily complex or wordy writing
4. **Missing Context**: Assuming reviewers know your field deeply
5. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Using different terms for same concept

### Technical Mistakes

1. **Inadequate Methods**: Insufficient detail to judge feasibility
2. **Overly Ambitious**: Too much proposed for timeline/budget
3. **No Preliminary Data**: For mechanisms requiring demonstrated feasibility
4. **Poor Timeline**: Unrealistic or poorly justified schedule
5. **Misaligned Budget**: Budget doesn't support proposed activities

### Formatting Mistakes

1. **Exceeding Page Limits**: Automatic rejection
2. **Wrong Font or Margins**: Non-compliant formatting
3. **Missing Required Sections**: Incomplete application
4. **Poor Figure Quality**: Illegible or unprofessional figures
5. **Inconsistent Citations**: Formatting errors in references

### Strategic Mistakes

1. **Wrong Program or Mechanism**: Proposing to inappropriate opportunity
2. **Weak Team**: Insufficient expertise or missing key collaborators
3. **No Broader Impacts**: For NSF, failing to adequately address
4. **Ignoring Program Priorities**: Not aligning with current emphasis areas
5. **Late Submission**: Technical issues or rushed preparation

## Workflow for Grant Development

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (2-6 months before deadline)

**Activities**:
- Identify appropriate funding opportunities
- Review program announcements and requirements
- Consult with program officers (if appropriate)
- Assemble team and confirm collaborations
- Develop preliminary data (if needed)
- Outline research plan and specific aims
- Review successful proposals (if available)

**Outputs**:
- Selected funding opportunity
- Assembled team with defined roles
- Preliminary outline of specific aims
- Gap analysis of needed preliminary data

### Phase 2: Drafting (2-3 months before deadline)

**Activities**:
- Write specific aims or objectives (start here!)
- Develop project description/research strategy
- Create figures and data visualizations
- Draft timeline and milestones
- Prepare preliminary budget
- Write broader impacts or significance sections
- Request letters of support/collaboration

**Outputs**:
- Complete first draft of narrative sections
- Preliminary budget with justification
- Timeline and management plan
- Requested letters from collaborators

### Phase 3: Internal Review (1-2 months before deadline)

**Activities**:
- Circulate draft to co-investigators
- Seek feedback from colleagues and mentors
- Request institutional review (if required)
- Mock review session (if possible)
- Revise based on feedback
- Refine budget and budget justification

**Outputs**:
- Revised draft incorporating feedback
- Refined budget aligned with revised plan
- Identified weaknesses and mitigation strategies

### Phase 4: Finalization (2-4 weeks before deadline)

**Activities**:
- Final revisions to narrative
- Prepare all required forms and documents
- Finalize budget and budget justification
- Compile biosketches, CVs, and current & pending
- Collect letters of support
- Prepare data management plan (if required)
- Write project summary/abstract
- Proofread all materials

**Outputs**:
- Complete, polished proposal
- All required supplementary documents
- Formatted according to agency requirements

### Phase 5: Submission (1 week before deadline)

**Activities**:
- Institutional review and approval
- Upload to submission portal
- Verify all documents and formatting
- Submit 24-48 hours before deadline
- Confirm successful submission
- Receive confirmation and proposal number

**Outputs**:
- Submitted proposal
- Submission confirmation
- Archived copy of all materials

**Critical Tip**: Never wait until the deadline. Portals crash, files corrupt, and emergencies happen. Aim for 48 hours early.
