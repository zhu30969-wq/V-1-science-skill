# DeepSpot-M API reference

Everything here builds on the two calls in `SKILL.md`: `DeepSpotM.from_pretrained` and
`model.predict_genes`.

## Loading a model

```python
from deepspotm import DeepSpotM

model, image_processor = DeepSpotM.from_pretrained("ratschlab/DeepSpotM", source="scgpt")
```

`from_pretrained` returns two objects:

- `model`: the PyTorch model that answers gene queries.
- `image_processor`: the transform that turns one 224x224 PIL tile into the tensor the
  model reads. Always use the processor that came back with the model rather than a
  hand-written transform, so normalisation matches the weights.

Arguments:

- The repository id, `"ratschlab/DeepSpotM"`. It is gated, so request access on the model
  page and run `huggingface-cli login` before the first call.
- `source`: which frozen gene embedding the router builds gene-specific projections from.
  One of `evo2`, `orthrus`, `prott5`, `scgpt`, `apertus`.

The first call downloads weights into the Hugging Face cache. Set `HF_HOME` to place that
cache on a volume with room for it, which matters on a shared cluster where the default
home directory is small.

## Choosing an embedding source

| `source`  | Gene embedding         |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| `evo2`    | genomic sequence       |
| `orthrus` | RNA                    |
| `prott5`  | protein sequence       |
| `scgpt`   | single-cell expression |
| `apertus` | language model         |

The gene router turns whichever embedding you pick into per-gene projections, which is
what makes genes queryable rather than fixed outputs. Each source describes gene identity
from a different modality, so the same gene is represented differently under each one.

Pick one source per run and keep it fixed across every tile in a slide or cohort, so the
values stay comparable. When the choice matters to a conclusion, run the same tiles
through several sources and report the values side by side:

```python
genes = ["EPCAM", "CD3D", "PTPRC"]

per_source = {}
for source in ("scgpt", "prott5", "evo2"):
    model, image_processor = DeepSpotM.from_pretrained("ratschlab/DeepSpotM", source=source)
    tiles = torch.stack([image_processor(require_tile(t)) for t in pil_tiles])
    per_source[source] = model.predict_genes(tiles, genes)
```

Reload the model when you change `source`, and rebuild the tile batch with the processor
returned alongside it.

## Predicting genes

```python
vals = model.predict_genes(image_processor(pil_tile).unsqueeze(0), ["EPCAM", "CD3D"])
```

The first argument is a batch tensor of processed tiles. The second is a list of gene
symbols. A single tile still needs the batch dimension, which is what `unsqueeze(0)` adds.

### Gene symbols

Pass HGNC gene symbols as uppercase strings, for example `EPCAM`, `CD3D`, `PTPRC`,
`MKI67`. The queryable genes are the ~19k-symbol panel shipped with the weights as
`tokens.csv`, exposed on the loaded model as `model.gene_names`. A symbol outside that
panel raises `KeyError` naming the offending genes, and predicting genes outside the
panel is not part of this release. Check membership up front when a gene list comes from
elsewhere:

```python
panel = set(model.gene_names)
missing = [g for g in genes if g not in panel]
if missing:
    raise ValueError(f"Not in the DeepSpot-M panel: {missing}")
```

Two habits keep a run reproducible:

- Map aliases to current HGNC symbols before querying, so `CD45` becomes `PTPRC`. Reading
  the list from a file keeps the mapping visible in the run.
- Keep the gene list beside the output. Values come back in the order requested, and the
  list is the only label the array carries.

```python
genes = [line.strip() for line in open("genes.txt") if line.strip()]
vals = model.predict_genes(tiles, genes)
```

Ask for every gene you need in one call rather than looping one gene at a time. The tile
tokens are computed once per batch and reused across the gene queries.

## Batching

`image_processor` handles one tile, so build a batch by stacking:

```python
import torch

batch = torch.stack([image_processor(require_tile(t)) for t in pil_tiles])
vals = model.predict_genes(batch, genes)
```

Batch size trades throughput against memory. Start at 32 tiles on a GPU and 8 on CPU, then
raise it while memory allows. Memory grows with both the batch and the number of genes in
one call, so lower one when the other is large.

## Device placement

`from_pretrained` accepts a `device` argument and returns the model already in eval mode
on that device, and `predict_genes` runs under `no_grad` on its own. So device handling
is one argument plus putting each batch on the same device:

```python
import torch

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model, image_processor = DeepSpotM.from_pretrained(
    "ratschlab/DeepSpotM", source="scgpt", device=device
)

vals = model.predict_genes(batch.to(device), genes)
```

Keeping the model on the device across batches is what makes a slide-scale run practical.
Move results back with `.cpu()` before converting to NumPy.

## Output units

Values are log1p-CPM, the same scale as `log1p` normalised counts per million in a
single-cell or spatial expression matrix. It is the scale most downstream tools expect, so
feed it straight into clustering, correlation or spatial statistics.

To read values as CPM instead, invert the transform:

```python
import numpy as np

cpm = np.expm1(vals.cpu().numpy())
```

Compare values across tiles and slides on the log1p-CPM scale, since that is the scale the
model produces.

## Handling the gated download

`from_pretrained` fails when the machine has no access token or the access request is
still pending. Report the whole path back to a working call rather than the raw error:

```python
DEEPSPOTM_HELP = (
    "DeepSpot-M is unavailable. Install it with `uv pip install deepspotm==1.0.0`, request "
    "access to the gated weights at https://huggingface.co/ratschlab/DeepSpotM, then "
    "authenticate with `huggingface-cli login`."
)

def load_deepspotm(source="scgpt"):
    try:
        from deepspotm import DeepSpotM
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise RuntimeError(DEEPSPOTM_HELP) from exc
    try:
        return DeepSpotM.from_pretrained("ratschlab/DeepSpotM", source=source)
    except Exception as exc:
        raise RuntimeError(DEEPSPOTM_HELP) from exc
```

On a cluster node with no outbound network, download the weights once on a login node and
point `HF_HOME` at the shared cache.
