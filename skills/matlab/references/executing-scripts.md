# Command-Line Execution, Products, and Migration

This reference explains reviewed execution plans. Bundled helpers never launch
MATLAB, GNU Octave, MATLAB Engine, MEX, a compiler, or any subprocess.

## Authorization gate

Before execution, confirm all of the following:

1. every `.m` file is trusted and statically reviewed;
2. no unreviewed `.mlx`, `.fig`, `.mlapp`, MEX, MAT object, project action,
   startup file, package, or generated artifact is reachable;
3. inputs and outputs are strict local paths with bounds and overwrite policy;
4. runtime, exact release, architecture, required products, and license are
   confirmed;
5. shell/native/Java/.NET/Python/code-generation surfaces are approved;
6. network, credentials, displays, and external services are understood;
7. the planned argv is shown to the user and execution is explicitly approved.

Static scan findings are not proof of safety. Never execute a file solely to
discover what it does.

## MATLAB R2026a `-batch`

MathWorks recommends `-batch` for noninteractive command-line workflows.
Conceptually, an approved plan looks like:

```text
["matlab", "-batch", "run('/reviewed/project/main.m')"]
```

This is argv, not an instruction to run untrusted code.

Official R2026a behavior:

- starts without the desktop or splash screen;
- executes the quoted statement noninteractively;
- logs text to standard output/error;
- disables settings changes and toolbox caching;
- can display figures unless paired with `-noFigureWindows` or `-nodisplay`;
- exits automatically with code 0 on success and nonzero on failure;
- errors if code requests interactive dialog input (except supported app-test
  fixtures);
- must not be combined with `-r`;
- requires the target to be in the startup folder or on the MATLAB path.

Use `-sd <reviewed-folder>` to set the initial folder. Do not embed untrusted
text in a MATLAB statement. Prefer a fixed function name and JSON-validated
scalar/list arguments converted by the planner.

MATLAB startup still matters. On Linux, the launcher processes
`.matlab7rc.sh`; MATLAB also runs `matlabrc.m` and the first executable
`startup` on its path. `finish.m` can run at normal exit. A MATLAB Project can
add paths and run startup/shutdown actions. `-sd` is not a security sandbox.

`-r` is for interactive workflows and has not been recommended for
noninteractive use since R2019a. Older `-r "...; exit"` patterns are easier to
hang or mask errors.

## Nonexecuting batch planner

```bash
python scripts/plan_batch_command.py matlab script src/main.m --root .
python scripts/plan_batch_command.py matlab function src/analyze.m \
  --root . --arg-json '{"value": 3}'
python scripts/plan_batch_command.py matlab tests tests/TestAnalyze.m --root .
```

The planner:

- validates a single `.m` target under `--root`;
- rejects symlinks, URLs, traversal, `.mlx`, MEX, and oversized paths;
- validates MATLAB identifiers and JSON values;
- returns argv, a MATLAB statement, assumptions, and warnings;
- marks `executes=false`;
- never checks `PATH`, calls a runtime, reads credentials, or spawns a process.

JSON object arguments are represented as a MATLAB `struct`; arrays and scalar
JSON values use bounded literal conversion. Review semantics and shape before
approval.

## GNU Octave 11.3.0 plans

The current manual documents:

- `--eval`/`-e` to evaluate code and exit;
- a filename argument to execute a script and exit;
- `--no-gui`, `--quiet`, and `--no-history`;
- `--no-init-all`/`--norc` to skip system and user initialization;
- `--path` to add a narrow function path;
- `--no-window-system` to disable graphics entirely.

For deterministic reviewed plans, prefer `--no-init-all --no-history
--quiet --no-gui`. Use `--no-window-system` only when graphics are not needed.
Octave also has site, version, user, local `.octaverc`, and MATLAB-compatible
`startup.m` files; skipping them changes expected user configuration and must
be a conscious choice.

Octave does not implement MATLAB `-batch`, Projects, or
`matlab.unittest`. Its BIST `test` function and `%!test` blocks are different.
Do not use an Octave result as proof that MATLAB code, graphics, toolboxes, or
deployment will behave identically.

## Functions, scripts, and test entry points

For automation:

- prefer a main function with explicit inputs/outputs;
- keep scripts free of base-workspace assumptions;
- avoid current-folder dependence and broad path mutation;
- return status through tests/errors rather than calling `exit` inside library
  code;
- place all output under a reviewed output root;
- do not request interactive input.

R2026a `runtests` automatically opens and closes a project when tests belong
to a project not already open. Review project startup/shutdown behavior before
using it.

Base MATLAB has `matlab.unittest`; parallel execution requires Parallel
Computing Toolbox. Advanced dependency selection, dashboards, generated tests,
coverage/equivalence features can require MATLAB Test or other products.

## Required products and license boundaries

Separate four questions:

1. **Static dependency:** Which products might code reference?
2. **Installation:** Which products/add-ons are installed?
3. **Entitlement:** Which licenses may this user/system use?
4. **Checkout:** Which licenses are available for this run?

`matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts` and Dependency Analyzer address
the first question imperfectly. `license("inuse")` observes only products used
on executed paths and itself requires launching MATLAB. None grants a license.

Do not automatically install MATLAB or a toolbox. Downloads, installers,
network-license configuration, and unattended automation are governed by the
user's MathWorks account, administrator, and license terms. The R2026a Program
Offering Guide has specific automation-server and external-application terms;
do not paraphrase it as legal permission.

## Compiler and generated-code boundaries

- **MATLAB Compiler** creates standalone/web applications that run with a
  release-compatible MATLAB Runtime.
- **MATLAB Compiler SDK** creates components for external languages.
- **MATLAB Coder** generates C/C++ source from supported MATLAB.
- **GPU Coder, Simulink Coder, Embedded Coder**, support packages, and target
  toolchains are separate products/capabilities.
- A platform C/C++/Fortran compiler may also be required and must appear in
  the current supported-compiler table.

Building requires MATLAB plus the compiler/code-generation product and all
products used by the source. Deployed applications can use MATLAB Runtime
under applicable terms, but Runtime does not execute arbitrary `.m` code and
cannot host MATLAB Engine for Python. Generated code must be verified; compiler
success is not scientific validation.

Never compile untrusted MATLAB, MEX, C/C++, model, or package input.

## CI design

A safe CI design uses:

- a pinned supported MATLAB release/update and platform;
- an administrator-approved license configuration;
- a reviewed project with no hidden startup action;
- immutable source and hashed inputs;
- a nonexecuting plan checked before the actual runner;
- bounded time/memory/output and no interactive dialogs;
- test results and logs that avoid environment/credential dumps;
- product and license failures distinguished from test failures;
- release notes and bug reports checked for the exact products.

MathWorks provides CI integrations, but their presence does not include MATLAB
or grant a license.

## Migration to R2026a

1. Run `codeCompatibilityReport` and Project Upgrade on reviewed code.
2. Run Code Analyzer and dependency analysis.
3. Review base MATLAB and every required product's R2026a release notes,
   compatibility considerations, supported platforms, compilers, Python, and
   bug reports.
4. Record reference outputs from the old release using justified tolerances.
5. Test startup/path behavior, data import, MAT files, graphics, Python,
   external interfaces, and deployment separately.
6. Check R2026a platform changes such as no new Intel Mac release.
7. Pilot before broad migration; retain rollback and provenance.

Notable base changes relevant to this skill include Python 3.13 support and
environment management, Python string conversion, JSON table/timetable I/O,
interactive HTML export, faster startup and selected kernels, and project-aware
`runtests`. Read the release notes rather than assuming this list is complete.
