# pydicom

Use pydicom for DICOM dataset I/O and pixel processing. Version 3.0.2 is the
current stable release reviewed here. It fixes CVE-2026-32711, a crafted
DICOMDIR path-traversal issue. pydicom 3.0.2 declares Python `>=3.10`; its
bundled DICOM dictionary is 2024c, while the live DICOM Standard may be newer.

## Mandatory safety boundary

- Work only with local data that the user is authorized to access.
- DICOM metadata, file names, private elements, overlays, structured content,
  and pixels may contain protected health information (PHI).
- Never print `Dataset`, export full metadata/JSON, or log element values by
  default. Use a documented allowlist and aggregate output.
- pydicom is a general DICOM framework, not a diagnostic viewer. Pixel output,
  validation, conversion, and plugin availability are not diagnostic claims.
- De-identification is profile-, purpose-, recipient-, jurisdiction-, and
  threat-context-specific. It requires privacy/DICOM expert verification.
- Never claim that a tag-removal script is DICOM PS3.15, HIPAA, GDPR, or other
  compliance. Preserve originals and audit derived outputs.
- Treat deterministic pseudonymization keys and UID maps as re-identification
  secrets: use least privilege and encrypted/managed secret storage, never
  commit, sync, log, or share them with derivatives, and define backup,
  rotation, revocation, and destruction procedures. A leaked key invalidates
  the intended separation; rotation also changes deterministic mappings.
- Set explicit input-file, file-count, frame-count, decoded-byte, and output
  limits before parsing untrusted or unusually large datasets.

## Installation

Create or activate an isolated environment, then install the exact reviewed
release:

```bash
uv pip install "pydicom==3.0.2"
```

Uncompressed pixel arrays and image rendering:

```bash
uv pip install "pydicom==3.0.2" "numpy==2.5.1" "Pillow==12.3.0"
```

Install only the transfer-syntax plugins required by the deployment:

```bash
# JPEG/JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000/HTJ2K, and faster RLE through pylibjpeg
uv pip install "numpy==2.5.1" "pylibjpeg==2.1.0" \
  "pylibjpeg-libjpeg==2.4.0" "pylibjpeg-openjpeg==2.5.0" \
  "pylibjpeg-rle==2.2.0"

# JPEG-LS encoder/decoder
uv pip install "numpy==2.5.1" "pyjpegls==1.5.1"

# Alternative decoder with platform-specific wheels
uv pip install "python-gdcm==3.2.6"
```

Plugin licenses and wheels differ by package/platform; review them before
deployment. Pillow has documented decoding limitations and pydicom cautions
that plugin output must be independently checked.

Native codec wheels widen the supply-chain and memory-safety boundary. For a
controlled deployment, resolve these exact pins on a trusted build host, lock
and verify wheel hashes/provenance, mirror approved artifacts internally, scan
them, and install with hash enforcement rather than resolving from the public
index at runtime.

## Choose the workflow

1. Need an aggregate overview: run `scripts/extract_metadata.py`.
2. Need bounded technical checks: run `scripts/dicom_inventory.py`.
3. Need codec deployment preflight: run
   `scripts/transfer_syntax_inspector.py`.
4. Need frame/memory planning: run `scripts/pixel_frame_planner.py`.
5. Need one non-diagnostic rendered frame: run
   `scripts/dicom_to_image.py`.
6. Need a pseudonymized derivative: read the de-identification section, create
   a site-reviewed action profile, then run `scripts/anonymize_dicom.py` and
   `scripts/deidentification_audit.py`.
7. Need to check a sensitive UID map: run
   `scripts/uid_mapping_validator.py`.

## Read datasets safely

`dcmread()` returns a `FileDataset`, a `Dataset` subclass with File Format
state such as `file_meta`, preamble, and original encoding.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pydicom

path = Path("authorized/input.dcm")
ds = pydicom.dcmread(
    path,
    stop_before_pixels=True,
    specific_tags=[
        "SOPClassUID",
        "Modality",
        "Rows",
        "Columns",
        "NumberOfFrames",
    ],
)

technical = {
    "sop_class": ds.get("SOPClassUID"),
    "modality": ds.get("Modality"),
    "rows": ds.get("Rows"),
    "columns": ds.get("Columns"),
}
```

Use:

- `stop_before_pixels=True` for metadata-only work.
- `specific_tags=[...]` for a minimum allowlist.
- `defer_size="1 MiB"` when a later write must preserve large values.
- `force=False` (default). `force=True` only bypasses the File Format header
  check; it does not prove the bytes are valid DICOM.

Do not call `print(ds)`, `repr(ds)`, or iterate values into logs on clinical
data.

## Dataset, DataElement, and sequences

Access standard elements by keyword and check for absence:

```python
modality = ds.get("Modality", "UNSPECIFIED")
if "ReferencedImageSequence" in ds:
    for item in ds.ReferencedImageSequence:
        referenced_class = item.get("ReferencedSOPClassUID")
```

Tag access, such as `ds[0x0010, 0x0010]`, returns a `DataElement`; its `.value`
is separate. `Sequence` behaves like a list of nested `Dataset` items. Privacy
actions must recurse through every sequence item, not only the top level.

When creating a file, use `FileMetaDataset` for group `0002`, keep dataset and
file-meta SOP UIDs consistent, set a Transfer Syntax UID, and write in enforced
File Format:

```python
from pydicom import dcmwrite
from pydicom.dataset import FileDataset, FileMetaDataset
from pydicom.uid import CTImageStorage, ExplicitVRLittleEndian, generate_uid

meta = FileMetaDataset()
meta.MediaStorageSOPClassUID = CTImageStorage
meta.MediaStorageSOPInstanceUID = generate_uid()
meta.TransferSyntaxUID = ExplicitVRLittleEndian

ds = FileDataset(None, {}, file_meta=meta, preamble=b"\0" * 128)
ds.SOPClassUID = meta.MediaStorageSOPClassUID
ds.SOPInstanceUID = meta.MediaStorageSOPInstanceUID
# Add all attributes required by the selected IOD before writing.
dcmwrite("new.dcm", ds, enforce_file_format=True, overwrite=False)
```

`write_like_original` is deprecated in pydicom 3.0; use
`enforce_file_format`. A successful write is not full PS3.3 IOD conformance.

## UIDs and transfer syntax

The File Meta Information Transfer Syntax UID controls dataset encoding and
pixel compression:

```python
ts = ds.file_meta.TransferSyntaxUID
summary = {
    "uid": str(ts),
    "name": ts.name,
    "compressed": ts.is_compressed,
    "implicit_vr": ts.is_implicit_VR,
    "little_endian": ts.is_little_endian,
}
```

pydicom 3.0 chooses write encoding from the Transfer Syntax UID before legacy
dataset flags. Do not replace structural UIDs (Transfer Syntax, SOP Class, or
coding-scheme UIDs) during pseudonymization. Instance/reference UID replacement
must be one-to-one and consistent across the complete declared scope.

Read [references/transfer_syntaxes.md](references/transfer_syntaxes.md) before
compression, decompression, or encapsulation.

## Pixel data and frames

The stable `pydicom.pixels` API supports path-based, frame-specific decoding:

```python
from pydicom.pixels import pixel_array

# Reads only the selected frame where the source permits it.
frame = pixel_array("authorized/image.dcm", index=0, raw=False)
```

Shape semantics:

- grayscale single frame: `(rows, columns)`
- grayscale multi-frame: `(frames, rows, columns)`
- color single frame: `(rows, columns, samples)`
- color multi-frame: `(frames, rows, columns, samples)`

`raw=False` converts YCbCr pixel data to RGB when possible; `raw=True` retains
the decoded color space after mandatory minimal processing. Use
`iter_pixels(path, indices=[...])` for bounded multi-frame iteration.

For grayscale display, apply transforms in this order:

```python
from pydicom.pixels import apply_modality_lut, apply_voi_lut

modality_values = apply_modality_lut(frame, ds)
display_values = apply_voi_lut(modality_values, ds, index=0)
```

Modality LUT/rescale and VOI/windowing change display/value semantics.
MONOCHROME1 may require presentation inversion. Palette Color requires
`apply_color_lut()`. Presentation states and ICC behavior may require a
validated viewer. Never use per-frame min/max normalization for quantitative
analysis.

## Compression, decompression, and encapsulation

- Accessing `pixel_array` decodes as needed but does not change the dataset.
- `Dataset.decompress()` changes Pixel Data in place, sets Explicit VR Little
  Endian, updates image metadata, and generates a new SOP Instance UID by
  default.
- `Dataset.compress(uid)` changes Pixel Data and Transfer Syntax in place and
  generates a new SOP Instance UID by default.
- pydicom 3.0 built-in/found encoders cover RLE Lossless, JPEG-LS, and JPEG
  2000 combinations documented in the stable plugin matrix.
- Each compressed frame is separately encoded and then encapsulated. Use
  `encapsulate()` or `encapsulate_extended()` for externally encoded frames.
- Read frames with current `pydicom.encaps.generate_frames()` or `get_frame()`;
  legacy encapsulation generator names are deprecated for pydicom 4.

Always inspect capabilities first, limit decoded bytes/frames, and verify pixel
correctness independently. Lossy compression acceptability is outside pydicom
and the DICOM encoding specification.

## DICOM JSON and private elements

`Dataset.to_json()`, `to_json_dict()`, and `Dataset.from_json()` implement the
DICOM JSON Model, but pydicom documents JSON support as beta. Full JSON may
inline binary data and expose every identifier and pixel payload. Do not emit
it as a metadata report. A `BulkDataURI` handler introduces separate storage,
authorization, and retrieval obligations.

Private elements are not standardized and may contain PHI:

```python
# Recursive removal, but not sufficient de-identification by itself.
ds.remove_private_tags()
```

Retain private elements only under an explicit reviewed safe-private policy.
Read [references/common_tags.md](references/common_tags.md) for tag access,
privacy classes, and standard pointers.

## De-identification workflow

DICOM PS3.15 Annex E explicitly states that confidentiality profiles do not
guarantee removal of all identifying information and do not replace a complete
de-identification process.

1. Define purpose, recipients, linkage needs, regulations, threat model, and
   acceptable re-identification risk.
2. Select the Basic Application Level Confidentiality Profile and needed
   options (pixel, recognizable visual features, graphics, structured content,
   descriptors, temporal information, patient characteristics, devices,
   institutions, UIDs, and safe private data).
3. Preserve source objects unchanged in controlled storage.
4. Apply every action recursively, including nested sequences.
5. Replace instance/reference UIDs consistently across the complete scope;
   preserve structural UIDs.
6. Decide date/time handling explicitly. A fixed shift can preserve intervals
   but partial dates, time zones, standalone times, leap days, longitudinal
   linkage, and external events require reviewed policy.
7. Inspect pixels, overlays, graphics, structured content, and recognizable
   visual features. Do not infer clean pixels from missing metadata or set
   `BurnedInAnnotation=NO` without verification.
8. Rebuild File Meta Information and preamble to prevent leakage.
9. Run technical validation and a de-identification audit, then perform expert
   verification and documented risk review.

The bundled script intentionally sets `PatientIdentityRemoved` to `NO` because
it cannot establish successful de-identification.

## Helper CLIs

All `--help` paths are dependency-free. The tools perform no network access and
emit no DICOM values beyond narrow technical allowlists.

Bundled content consists of the two linked references, the documented helper
scripts, and synthetic tests. The pydicom runtime dependency is installed from
the pinned PyPI release.

```bash
# Redacted aggregate metadata
python scripts/extract_metadata.py authorized/ --recursive

# Metadata-only technical inventory
python scripts/dicom_inventory.py authorized/ --recursive

# Installed codec/plugin capabilities
python scripts/transfer_syntax_inspector.py --input authorized/image.dcm

# Frame shape, byte, and transform plan
python scripts/pixel_frame_planner.py authorized/image.dcm --frames 0,2-4

# One non-diagnostic frame
python scripts/dicom_to_image.py authorized/image.dcm frame.png \
  --acknowledge-pixel-phi

# Create a secret key, then a scoped pseudonymized derivative plus audit
python scripts/anonymize_dicom.py --generate-uid-key project.key
python scripts/anonymize_dicom.py authorized/in.dcm derived/out.dcm \
  --uid-key-file project.key --uid-scope export-v1 \
  --audit-report derived/out.audit.json

# Audit candidate metadata; no pixel decompression
python scripts/deidentification_audit.py derived/out.dcm

# Validate an explicitly requested sensitive UID mapping
python scripts/uid_mapping_validator.py derived/uid-map.json \
  --uid-key-file project.key --uid-scope export-v1
```

The generated raw key file is a controlled-local convenience and is created
with owner-only permissions. For production, materialize key bytes from an
approved secret manager into a locked ephemeral file, restrict access to the
de-identification service, and securely remove it afterward. Store any optional
UID map separately from derivatives; it directly links original and replacement
identifiers.

## pydicom 3.0 migration notes

- `read_file()` and `write_file()` were removed; use `dcmread()` and
  `dcmwrite()`.
- `write_like_original` is deprecated; use `enforce_file_format`.
- `pydicom.pixel_data_handlers` is deprecated for removal in v4; use
  `pydicom.pixels`.
- `Dataset.pixel_array` uses the new pixels backend by default and converts
  YCbCr to RGB when possible.
- `JPEGLossless` now means UID `1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57`;
  `JPEGLosslessSV1` is `.70`.
- `Dataset.is_little_endian` and `is_implicit_VR` are deprecated for v4.
