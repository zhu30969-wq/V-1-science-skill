# Report-Type Routing

Select one route before opening a template. Do not merge routes merely because artifacts share clinical data.

## Decision sequence

1. Is the artifact a patient-care record?
   Stop. This skill does not create SOAP notes, H&Ps, consultation notes, discharge summaries, prescriptions, orders, triage instructions, or signed diagnostic reports.
2. Is it a single clinical case intended for publication?
   Use CARE.
3. Is it a diagnostic-report scaffold controlled by a clinical service?
   Use ACR, the current specimen-specific CAP protocol, or CLIA as applicable.
4. Is it a randomized-trial protocol?
   Use SPIRIT 2025 and applicable extensions.
5. Is it a randomized-trial results manuscript?
   Use CONSORT 2025 and applicable extensions.
6. Is it an integrated report of one clinical study for regulatory review?
   Use ICH E3 plus E3 Q&A, with ICH E6(R3) and regional requirements as applicable.
7. Is it individual pre-approval safety information?
   Route to ICH E2A, E2B(R3), protocol/sponsor procedures, and regional requirements. Do not automate the reportability decision.
8. Is it individual post-approval safety information?
   Route to ICH E2D(R1), E2B(R3), marketing-authorisation-holder procedures, and regional requirements. Do not automate.
9. Is it an aggregate safety table?
   Use the protocol/SAP, ICH E3, CONSORT Harms when applicable, and the relevant regional aggregate-analysis guidance.
10. Is it an aggregate research summary?
    Use the reporting guideline for the actual design and the verified protocol/SAP. Do not imply clinical applicability.

## Route matrix

| Artifact | Base source | Add-ons | Do not substitute |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case report | CARE 2013 | CARE 2017 explanation; target journal | CONSORT, CSR, or diagnostic-report rules |
| Radiology scaffold | ACR 2025 communication parameter | Current modality/program standard and local policy | A generic impression generator |
| Cancer pathology scaffold | Current CAP protocol for exact organ/specimen | Current biomarker protocol and local policy | A static generic TNM checklist |
| Laboratory scaffold | 42 CFR 493.1291 for applicable US nonwaived testing | Method, specialty, state, accreditor, and laboratory policy | Hardcoded reference or critical ranges |
| Trial protocol | SPIRIT 2025 | Current design/data/intervention extensions | CONSORT results checklist |
| Randomized results | CONSORT 2025 | Current design/data/intervention extensions; CONSORT Harms | SPIRIT protocol checklist |
| CSR | ICH E3 and E3 Q&A | E6(R3), protocol, SAP, regional submission rules | CONSORT alone |
| Pre-approval ICSR | ICH E2A and E2B(R3) | Regional law/guidance and sponsor procedure | Aggregate formatter |
| Post-approval ICSR | ICH E2D(R1) and E2B(R3) | Regional law/guidance and MAH procedure | Pre-approval timing rules |
| Periodic aggregate safety | ICH E2C(R2), where applicable | Regional periodic-report rules | E2B message schema |

## CONSORT/SPIRIT extension selection

The base statements address standard randomized trials. Check the live official extension catalogue for:

- design: adaptive, cluster, cluster-crossover, crossover, dose-finding, factorial, multi-arm, non-inferiority/equivalence, N-of-1, pilot/feasibility, pragmatic, stepped-wedge, routine-data, or within-person;
- data: abstracts, harms, outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, surrogate outcomes, equity, and pathology;
- intervention/population: non-pharmacological, AI, social/psychological, children/adolescents, or other specialty extensions.

Some current extensions were developed against CONSORT 2010 or SPIRIT 2013. Use the current extension with the 2025 base statement, document any conflict, and have a qualified methodologist resolve it. Do not silently renumber or reinterpret extension items.

## Jurisdiction and role gate

ICH Step 4 adoption does not itself prove implementation in a jurisdiction. FDA guidance is generally nonbinding but regulations are legally operative within scope. Institutional policy, protocol, contracts, ethics determinations, and sponsor procedures may add or change duties.

Record the jurisdiction, regulated-product category, responsible role, source version/date, and reviewer before drafting. If any is unknown, mark the route `BLOCKED_UNRESOLVED`.
