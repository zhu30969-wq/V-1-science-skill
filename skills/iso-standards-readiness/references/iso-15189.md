# ISO 15189 Process Framework (No Standard Text)

Research basis: **2026-07-26**. This reference summarizes a preparation process and
evidence architecture for medical laboratory quality and competence work. It does not
reproduce requirements and is not a substitute for the standard.

## Copyright and authorized access

ISO publications are copyrighted. Obtain ISO 15189 from
[ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/76677.html), an ISO national member, or another
authorized source; see [ISO copyright](https://www.iso.org/copyright.html). Do not ask
an agent to retrieve, transcribe, summarize clause-by-clause, or store proprietary
text. Accreditation-body and CAP checklists that quote requirements are separately
licensed material — do not paste them into shared repositories or prompts.

## Current edition and the closed transition

- [ISO 15189:2022](https://www.iso.org/standard/76677.html) is Edition 4, published
  December 2022, cancelling and replacing ISO 15189:2012. Confirm on the ISO catalogue
  page, which refused automated access during this research.
- The 2022 edition aligns structurally with ISO/IEC 17025:2017 and **incorporates
  point-of-care testing requirements previously held in ISO 22870**. Do not cite
  ISO 22870 as a separate current POCT basis without confirming its status.
- The ILAC-agreed transition for accredited medical laboratories ran to **December
  2025**. A 2012-based quality system is out of date, not "in transition" — do not
  build a gap baseline that assumes a future deadline.
- Record publisher, title, edition, amendments, authorized location, access date,
  source owner, currency-review date, impact decision, and approval in the controlled
  source ledger.

## Keep four lanes separate

### 1. ISO 15189 accreditation

An accreditation body grants accreditation for a defined scope of examinations, per
laboratory and per location, under ISO/IEC 17011. A medical laboratory is
**accredited**, not "ISO 15189 certified." Since 2026-01-01 the recognition arrangement
sits with Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated; verify current claim and logo
wording with the accreditation body.

### 2. United States CLIA certification

CLIA certification by CMS is **mandatory** before a US laboratory may accept human
specimens for testing. It is federal law, not a voluntary quality scheme.

**ISO 15189 accreditation does not satisfy CLIA and cannot replace a CLIA-based
accreditation.** Deemed status flows only from a CMS-approved accreditation
organization's program. CMS approves a limited set of accreditation organizations whose
standards must meet or exceed CLIA requirements, with reapproval every six years or
more often; read the
[current AO list](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Downloads/AOList.pdf)
rather than relying on a remembered count. The CAP 15189 program is layered on top of
CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program accreditation rather than offered as a standalone
substitute — confirm current prerequisites with CAP.

Never let an ISO 15189 readiness output be read as CLIA compliance, deemed status,
licensure, or an inspection result.

### 3. Other national licensure and inspection regimes

State licensure, national health-authority requirements, and payer conditions of
participation are separate again, with their own inspection processes and their own
records. Non-US jurisdictions may make ISO 15189 accreditation mandatory, voluntary, or
irrelevant. This is an applicability decision for authorized humans.

### 4. IVD device regulation

The performance of an in vitro diagnostic device, and any laboratory-developed test
regime that applies to it, is regulated separately from laboratory accreditation. EU
IVDR conformity assessment, notified-body involvement, and performance-study
requirements are not laboratory accreditation questions. See `references/iso-13485.md`
and the EU entries in `references/source-ledger.md`.

## Hard boundary

This skill and its files cannot:

- accredit a laboratory, issue or validate an accreditation certificate or schedule,
  or predict an assessment or inspection outcome;
- establish CLIA certification, deemed status, licensure, or personnel qualification;
- decide which scheme, jurisdiction requirement, or payer condition applies;
- replace the laboratory director, quality manager, authorized signatory,
  accreditation body, assessor, EQA provider, or competent authority;
- verify or validate an examination procedure, set biological reference intervals,
  establish traceability of assigned values, or judge clinical suitability; or
- infer competence or patient safety from a document title, keyword, template,
  checklist, or script result.

Use outputs as a list of evidence questions for accountable human review.

## Scope of accreditation is per examination

Each scope item is defined by discipline, the examination or measurand reported, the
controlled procedure and its issue, and the primary sample type with its acceptance
requirements. Point-of-care testing performed under the laboratory's responsibility
belongs in the scope discussion explicitly, including devices operated by clinical
staff outside the laboratory.

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 scripts/validate_scope_intake.py \
  /path/to/medical-laboratory-scope-intake.json --standard iso-15189
```

Copy `assets/templates/medical-laboratory-scope-intake-template.json` outside the skill
first. The distributed template fails closed by design.

## Process and evidence domains

The `iso-15189` profile carries these domain labels for manifests and gap reports.
They are workflow topics, not clause references:

`scope-and-impartiality`, `organizational-structure-and-governance`,
`personnel-competence`, `facilities-and-safety`, `equipment-and-calibration`,
`metrological-traceability`, `reagents-and-consumables`,
`externally-provided-products-and-services`, `pre-examination-processes`,
`examination-methods-verification-and-validation`, `measurement-uncertainty`,
`validity-of-results-and-external-quality-assessment`, `point-of-care-testing`,
`post-examination-and-reporting`, `laboratory-information-management`, `complaints`,
`nonconformity-and-corrective-action`, `risk-management-and-improvement`,
`internal-audit`, `management-review`, `continuity-and-emergency-preparedness`.

Each domain needs an owner, status, evidence IDs, source/version reference, recorded
approval, and links to open gaps. Sample **records**, not only procedures.

## Where medical laboratory evidence differs from ISO/IEC 17025

### Pre-examination processes carry disproportionate risk

Most avoidable patient harm originates before the analyser: request content and
patient identification, collection and identification of the primary sample, transport
and stability conditions, acceptance and rejection criteria, and handling of
compromised samples. Sample: rejection records, identification-error events, transport
excursions, and the resulting investigations — not only the collection manual.

### Post-examination and reporting is clinical communication

Assemble evidence for result review and authorization, reference intervals and
clinical decision limits with their basis, interpretive comments and who is authorized
to make them, report content and amendment or retraction handling, and — the item most
often thin — **critical-result notification with documented read-back and
timeliness**. Turnaround-time monitoring belongs here too.

### Point-of-care testing is inside the scope

POCT requirements now sit within ISO 15189. Record governance of devices outside the
laboratory, operator training and authorization, connectivity and result capture into
the patient record, quality-control regimes, and reconciliation with central
laboratory methods.

### Verification is the normal case, validation the exception

Most medical laboratories verify commercial IVD examinations for their own setting
rather than validating a new method. Record which performance characteristics were
verified against the manufacturer's claims, the acceptance criteria, the data, and the
authorized approval to report patient results. Laboratory-developed and modified
procedures need the fuller validation evidence and the applicable regulatory analysis.

### External quality assessment, not just proficiency testing

Record EQA enrolment per scope item, results, evaluation against criteria, and
investigation of unsatisfactory performance. Where no EQA scheme exists for an
examination, record the alternative comparison approach and its authorization. An
unacceptable EQA outcome with no documented investigation is a blocker.

### Metrological traceability of assigned values

For measurands where higher-order reference materials and reference measurement
procedures exist, record the traceability of assigned values and the resulting
commutability and comparability limitations. Where no reference system exists, record
that fact and what the laboratory does about result comparability.

### Risk and continuity are explicit

The 2022 edition treats risk to patients as a running requirement rather than an annex.
Record identified risks, controls, residual acceptance with authority, and improvement
actions. Continuity and emergency preparedness — instrument failure, LIS outage,
reagent supply interruption, facility loss — needs tested arrangements, not a plan
nobody has exercised.

## Shared checks that apply here

- `scripts/audit_document_records.py` — controlled documents, records, retention basis,
  and external-source currency. Standard-agnostic.
- `scripts/check_capa.py` — nonconformity and corrective action with effectiveness
  evidence before closure.
- `scripts/check_supplier_controls.py` — reagents, consumables, calibration providers,
  and referral laboratories, including the referral laboratory's own accreditation or
  licensure status.
- `scripts/validate_evidence_manifest.py` and `scripts/gap_analyzer.py` with
  `--standard iso-15189`.

`scripts/check_traceability.py` and `scripts/check_qmsr_transition.py` are
device-lifecycle checks and do not apply here.

## Common preparation failures

- Presenting ISO 15189 readiness as CLIA compliance or deemed status.
- Saying "certified" when the laboratory is accredited.
- Citing ISO 22870 as the current separate POCT basis, or ISO 15189:2012 as current.
- POCT devices operating outside the laboratory with no governance, training, or QC
  evidence in the accreditation scope discussion.
- Critical-result notification procedures with no notification records or timeliness
  evidence.
- Reference intervals adopted from a package insert with no documented basis for the
  served population.
- EQA scores filed without investigation of unsatisfactory results.
- Continuity plans that have never been exercised.
