# ISO 13485 Process Framework (No Standard Text)

Research basis: **2026-07-23**. This reference summarizes a preparation process and
evidence architecture. It does not reproduce ISO requirements and is not a substitute
for the standard.

## Copyright and authorized access

ISO publications are copyrighted. Obtain ISO 13485 and related standards from
[ISO](https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html), an ISO national member, or another
authorized source. ISO states that unauthorized copying, scanning, or distribution is
prohibited; see [ISO copyright](https://www.iso.org/copyright.html). Do not ask an
agent to retrieve, transcribe, summarize clause-by-clause, or store proprietary text.

For the U.S. QMSR incorporation by reference, FDA identifies read-only access through
the ANSI IBR portal in its
[QMSR FAQ](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/quality-management-system-regulation-qmsr/quality-management-system-regulation-frequently-asked-questions).
That access does not remove copyright or permit copying.

## Current edition and the 2021 European amendment

- [ISO 13485:2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html) is Edition 3,
  published March 2016. ISO completed its 2025 systematic review and confirmed the
  edition on 2025-10-31; it remains current as of this research date.
- Do not call **EN ISO 13485:2016/A11:2021** an ISO international Amendment 1.
  It is a European amendment to the EN adoption. The current EU harmonised-standards
  lists include EN ISO 13485:2016, AC:2018, and A11:2021. Verify the current OJEU
  citation on the Commission's
  [harmonised standards page](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-topics-interest/harmonised-standards_en).
- FDA incorporated ISO 13485:2016(E), Third edition, March 1, 2016. A later ISO or
  EN publication does not silently change the edition incorporated in Part 820.

Record exact publisher, title, edition, amendment/corrigendum, authorized location,
access date, source owner, currency-review date, impact decision, and approval.

## Hard boundary

This skill and its files cannot:

- certify a QMS or issue/validate a certificate;
- determine legal or regulatory applicability, device classification, reportability,
  conformity route, market access, or product authorization;
- replace the authorized management representative, top management, RA/QA, legal
  counsel, competent/regulatory authority, notified body, MDSAP Auditing
  Organization, accreditation body, or certification body;
- infer effective implementation from a document title, keyword, template, checklist,
  or script result; or
- claim compliance, conformity, certification, or inspection readiness.

Use outputs as a list of evidence questions for accountable human review.

## Keep the assurance regimes separate

`references/assurance-lanes.md` holds the full lane table across every standard in this
skill, including how certification differs from laboratory accreditation. The
device-specific detail follows here.

### ISO 13485 management-system certification

A certification body audits the defined QMS scope against the authorized standard and
its certification scheme. The certificate is limited to its stated organization, sites,
activities, products/technical areas, standard edition, and validity. Certification is
not FDA approval, an FDA inspection exemption, an MDSAP audit, an EU device
certificate, or a legal-applicability decision.

For accredited ISO 13485 certification, verify the certification body's accreditation
scope. As of 2026, Global Accreditation Cooperation Incorporated has replaced IAF
and ILAC operationally. Its document library carries IAF MD 8:2023 and IAF MD
9:2023 while successor documents are developed. These documents concern
accreditation and certification-body practice, not product authorization.

### FDA QMSR inspection and compliance

The [QMSR](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/quality-management-system-regulation-qmsr)
became effective **2026-02-02** and FDA began enforcement on that date. The current
[21 CFR Part 820](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-H/part-820)
is titled *Quality Management System Regulation*. It incorporates ISO 13485:2016
and contains FDA scope, definitions, incorporation, QMS, record, and
labeling/packaging provisions. Other applicable FDA requirements still matter.

On 2026-02-02 FDA stopped using QSIT and began the inspection process in
[Compliance Program 7382.850](https://www.fda.gov/media/80195/download?attachment).
This is now a post-effective-date implementation state, not a future transition.
FDA may inspect QMS records created before the effective date and records that had
previously been exempt from routine review under the old regulation, as explained in
the QMSR FAQ.

Do not use the former 21 CFR 820 section structure as a current requirements map.
Inventory legacy QSR/QSIT references, disposition them under change control, and use
the current eCFR, incorporated edition, and linked current FDA regulations.

### MDSAP regulatory audit

MDSAP is a regulatory audit conducted by an MDSAP-recognized Auditing
Organization for participating jurisdictions. The current official
[MDSAP Audit Approach](https://www.mdsap.global/documents/library/audit-approach)
is **MDSAP AU P0002.010**, version date **2026-02-02**. It uses a process-based
approach and includes jurisdiction-specific requirements.

An ISO certificate alone is not an MDSAP audit. FDA inspections under QMSR do not
follow the MDSAP audit plan, and FDA does not issue ISO 13485 certificates. MDSAP
participation does not eliminate every possible regulatory inspection or
product-specific obligation.

### EU MDR/IVDR conformity assessment

The MDR and IVDR impose legal obligations beyond a generic QMS. Use the current
consolidated regulation and current, product-specific conformity route:

- [Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/745/2026-01-01/eng)
  — consolidated version dated 2026-01-01 as of this research.
- [Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (IVDR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2017/746/2025-01-10/eng)
  — current consolidated version dated 2025-01-10 as of this research.
- [MDCG guidance index](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-sector/new-regulations/guidance-mdcg-endorsed-documents-and-other-guidance_en)
  — guidance is not legally binding and is versioned/revised.

Notified bodies are designated by Member States for specified legislation,
conformity-assessment tasks, and designation codes. Verify current scope in
[NANDO](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/single-market-compliance-space/notified-bodies).
Accreditation or ISO certification does not by itself confer notified-body designation
or establish EU product conformity.

### Product- and market-specific requirements

Product classification, intended purpose, claims, software, cybersecurity, clinical or
performance evidence, biocompatibility, electrical safety, sterilization, UDI,
registration, reporting, and other controls depend on the device and jurisdiction.
Manage these in a separately approved applicability matrix. Never assume this
framework is complete for a product.

## QMS evidence domains

The domains below are workflow topics, not clause text. An authorized standard copy
and jurisdiction-specific sources remain the audit criteria.

### Scope, governance, and roles

Evidence should identify legal entities, sites, products/families, lifecycle activities,
outsourced processes, markets considered, interfaces, top-management authority,
management representative, RA/QA ownership, delegates, independence, and
escalation. Every applicability or not-applicable decision needs a named owner,
rationale, source/version, evidence, date, and approval.

### Document and record control

Control authoring, review, approval, effective use, distribution, revision,
obsolescence, external sources, retention, integrity, security, retrieval, correction,
audit trails, backup/recovery, and disposition. Preserve source/version evidence and
license restrictions. Link changes to training and validation before effective use.

### Risk management

Integrate product and process risk with intended use, design, suppliers, production,
software, validation, complaints, postmarket data, CAPA, and change control.
[ISO 14971:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html), Edition 3, was confirmed
in 2025. For EU work, distinguish EN ISO 14971:2019/A11:2021; the A11 amendment is
European and does not replace a product-specific legal analysis.

### Design and development

Maintain approved planning, responsibilities, inputs, outputs, review, verification,
validation, transfer, changes, and traceability. Evidence should show that risk
controls and postmarket learning feed the design/change system. A claimed
not-applicable design process requires authorized scope and regulatory review.

### Suppliers and outsourced processes

Use risk-based selection, evaluation, controls, purchasing information, acceptance,
change notification, sub-tier flow-down, monitoring, re-evaluation,
nonconformity/CAPA, and business-continuity evidence. Outsourcing does not transfer
the organization's accountability for its controlled process.

### Production, service, and validation

Define infrastructure, work environment, contamination/cleanliness where relevant,
controlled instructions, acceptance/release, labeling/packaging, preservation,
installation, servicing, process validation, monitoring/measurement equipment, and
change/revalidation triggers. Evidence must be product/process-specific.

### Software used in the QMS or production

Record intended use, risk, requirements, configuration, access, data integrity,
verification/validation, acceptance, release, incident handling, backup/recovery,
supplier controls, and change/revalidation. A software inventory or vendor
certificate alone is not validation.

### Identification and traceability

Define the required extent using approved product and jurisdictional decisions. Link
materials/components, process records, acceptance/release, distribution, servicing,
complaints, corrections/removals, and postmarket records as applicable.

### Complaints, vigilance, and postmarket

Control intake, evaluation, investigation, product/risk impact, trend analysis,
reportability decisions, communications, advisory/field actions, and feedback to
risk, design, production, suppliers, CAPA, and management review. Authorized roles
must make jurisdiction-specific reporting decisions.

### Nonconformity and CAPA

Separate correction/containment from cause-directed action. Preserve scope, risk and
reportability review, investigation, supported cause or conclusion, action ownership,
change links, implementation evidence, pre-defined effectiveness criteria,
independent review, and closure approval. Pending or ineffective checks cannot
support closure.

### Internal audit and management review

Use a risk-based audit program, objective criteria/scope/sampling, competent and
independent auditors, findings, corrections/CAPA, and effectiveness follow-up.
Management review should use controlled inputs and record decisions, resources,
actions, owners, dates, and follow-up. Neither activity can be replaced by a
checklist-generated score.

### Training, competence, and change control

Define role competence, training need, completion, effectiveness, authorization, and
records. Changes should assess source/version, product/risk, validation, software,
supplier, document, record, training, postmarket, regulatory, and certification/audit
impacts before implementation.

## Evidence quality rule

For each domain, require:

1. defined scope and accountable owner;
2. approved process/document status;
3. actual implementation records, not only a procedure;
4. traceable evidence IDs and controlled locations;
5. source/edition/version and currency-review evidence;
6. approval and effective dates;
7. open gaps, decisions, and change/CAPA links; and
8. sampling across products, sites, time periods, and risk where justified.

Use `references/source-ledger.md` for the dated official-source baseline.
