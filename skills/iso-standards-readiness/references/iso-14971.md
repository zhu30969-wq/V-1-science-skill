# ISO 14971 Process Framework (No Standard Text)

Research basis: **2026-07-26**, building on the 2026-07-23 device-lane baseline. This
reference summarizes a preparation process and evidence architecture for medical device
risk management. It does not reproduce requirements and is not a substitute for the
standard.

## Current edition, the guidance companion, and the European amendment

- [ISO 14971:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html) is Edition 3, published
  December 2019, reviewed and confirmed in 2025.
- [ISO/TR 24971:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/74437.html) is Edition 2 and is the
  guidance companion, following the same clause structure. It is a **Technical
  Report**: informative, not normative. Conformity is claimed to ISO 14971, never to
  ISO/TR 24971, and a TR cannot relax or reinterpret a normative requirement. Record
  which guidance the organization adopted and why.
- **EN ISO 14971:2019/A11:2021** is a European amendment to the EN adoption, cited for
  MDR and, through the corresponding decision, IVDR support. It does not change the
  international normative part. Track it only where the European source basis applies.

## No certification lane exists for this standard

There is no ISO 14971 certificate. A body cannot certify a risk-management system to
ISO 14971 the way it certifies a QMS to ISO 13485. Risk management is instead assessed
*inside* other lanes:

- an ISO 13485 certification audit examines the risk-management process as part of the
  QMS;
- an FDA inspection examines risk-based decisions against applicable FDA requirements;
- an MDSAP audit treats risk management as a foundation across its process areas; and
- EU conformity assessment examines the risk-management file as part of technical
  documentation against the applicable general safety and performance requirements.

Any claim of "ISO 14971 certification" is a category error. Report risk-management
readiness as evidence supporting a named lane, never as its own assurance result.

## Hard boundary

This skill and its files cannot:

- certify, approve, or validate a risk-management file or process;
- determine device classification, intended use, reportability, conformity route,
  market access, or product authorization;
- decide whether a risk is acceptable, whether benefit outweighs residual risk, or
  whether a risk-control measure is adequate or safe;
- set or approve risk-acceptability criteria, severity or probability scales, or a
  risk matrix;
- replace top management, the risk-management owner, qualified clinical and engineering
  reviewers, RA/QA, a notified body, or a regulator; or
- infer that a hazard set is complete, or that residual risk is acceptable, from a
  template, a matrix, a document count, or a script result.

Use outputs as a list of evidence questions for accountable human review. **Completeness
of hazard identification cannot be established by any check in this skill** — a
zero-finding structural result says the declared links are present, not that the
analysis found everything.

## Process and evidence domains

The `iso-14971` profile carries these domain labels for manifests and gap reports.
They are workflow topics, not clause references:

`risk-management-plan`, `risk-management-file`, `competence-and-authority`,
`intended-use-and-characteristics`, `hazard-identification`,
`risk-estimation-and-evaluation`, `risk-control-option-analysis`,
`risk-control-implementation-and-verification`, `risk-control-side-effects-review`,
`residual-risk-evaluation`, `benefit-risk-analysis`,
`overall-residual-risk-evaluation`, `risk-management-review-and-report`,
`production-and-postproduction-information`, `change-control`.

Each domain needs an owner, status, evidence IDs, source/version reference, recorded
approval, and links to open gaps.

## The chain that has to hold together

Risk-management evidence is judged as a connected chain, not as a set of documents. For
each analysed item, the following must be traceable in both directions:

intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse → characteristics related to safety →
hazard → foreseeable sequence of events → hazardous situation → harm with severity →
probability basis → risk evaluation against declared criteria → risk-control option
analysis and decision → implemented control → verification that the control was
implemented → verification of its effectiveness → review for new or increased risks
introduced by the control → residual risk evaluation → benefit-risk analysis where
residual risk is not acceptable → contribution to overall residual risk → disclosure of
residual risk → production and post-production information feeding back.

Break any one link and the file stops being evidence. The two links most often missing
are **verification of control effectiveness** (distinct from verifying the control
exists) and **review of risks introduced by the control itself**.

Build the traceability register with:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 scripts/check_traceability.py \
  /path/to/traceability-matrix.json
```

That check links intended use, hazard or signal, risk evaluation, risk control, design
input and output, verification, validation, production control, and post-market source.
It verifies declared linkage, not analytical adequacy.

## Where risk management meets the QMS

ISO 14971 work is not separable from the device QMS. Keep these joins explicit and
evidenced:

- **Design and development** — risk controls that are design outputs must appear as
  design inputs with verification, not only as risk-file rows.
- **Production** — controls realized as process parameters, in-process checks, or
  acceptance criteria need production evidence, and process validation where the
  control cannot be fully verified on the finished device.
- **Purchasing** — controls that depend on a supplier's process or component need
  supplier controls and change notification. See
  `scripts/check_supplier_controls.py`.
- **Post-market** — complaints, service records, vigilance signals, and production
  nonconformities must actually re-enter risk estimation, with evidence that the file
  was reassessed and that changed estimates were acted on.
- **CAPA** — where a risk estimate changes, the resulting action needs effectiveness
  evidence before closure. See `scripts/check_capa.py`.
- **Change control** — any change to intended use, design, process, supplier, or
  materials triggers a documented risk reassessment.

The production and post-production feedback loop is the single most common structural
gap: files that were complete at design transfer and never updated by field
experience.

## Risk-acceptability criteria and the matrix problem

Acceptability criteria belong in the risk-management plan, are set by authorized humans
with a documented rationale, and must be applied consistently. Recurring failure modes
to look for, none of which this skill can adjudicate:

- criteria written after the analysis so that every risk lands acceptable;
- probability values asserted with no stated basis and no data;
- a matrix whose cells were adjusted per project to move results across the boundary;
- risk reduction claimed from labelling or an instruction alone, where a design or
  protective measure was available;
- residual risk described as acceptable with no benefit-risk analysis where the
  declared criteria were not met;
- overall residual risk never evaluated as a whole — only item by item; and
- no disclosure of residual risk to users where the analysis assumed it.

Flag these as blockers for authorized review. Do not resolve them.

  families, intended use references, and applicability owners.
- `scripts/check_traceability.py` — the risk/design/production/post-market chain.
