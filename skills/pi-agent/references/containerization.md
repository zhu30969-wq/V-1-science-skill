# Containerization

Source: https://pi.dev/docs/latest/containerization

Pi runs with all permissions by default. Two general approaches: run the whole `pi` process inside an isolated environment, or run `pi` on the host and route tool execution into an isolated environment.

| Pattern | What is isolated | Best for | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gondolin extension | Built-in tools and `!` commands | Local micro-VM isolation while keeping auth on host | `examples/extensions/gondolin/` |
| Plain Docker | Whole `pi` process | Simplest local container boundary | Provider API keys enter the container |
| OpenShell | Whole `pi` process | Local or remote policy-controlled sandbox | Requires an OpenShell gateway |

Extensions run wherever the `pi` process runs. If host Pi routes built-ins into a VM, other custom extension tools still run on the host unless they delegate too.

## Gondolin

[Gondolin](https://github.com/earendil-works/gondolin) is a local Linux micro-VM.

```bash
cp -R packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/gondolin ~/.pi/agent/extensions/gondolin
cd ~/.pi/agent/extensions/gondolin
npm install --ignore-scripts

cd /path/to/project
pi -e ~/.pi/agent/extensions/gondolin
```

The extension mounts the host cwd at `/workspace` in the VM and overrides `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`. User `!` commands are routed into the VM as well, and file changes under `/workspace` write through to the host.

Requirements: Node.js >= 23.6.0 for `@earendil-works/gondolin`, plus QEMU installed through your package manager.

## Plain Docker

`Dockerfile.pi`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:24-bookworm-slim

RUN apt-get update \
  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends bash ca-certificates git ripgrep \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent

WORKDIR /workspace
ENTRYPOINT ["pi"]
```

```bash
docker build -t pi-sandbox -f Dockerfile.pi .

docker run --rm -it \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY \
  -v "$PWD:/workspace" \
  -v pi-agent-home:/root/.pi/agent \
  pi-sandbox
```

`-v "$PWD:/workspace"` means reads and writes inside `/workspace` affect host files directly. Use a named volume for `/root/.pi/agent` if you want container-local settings and sessions — mounting host `~/.pi/agent` exposes host auth and session files to the container.

## OpenShell

[NVIDIA OpenShell](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/about/overview) provides a policy-controlled sandbox with filesystem, process, network, credential, and inference controls. It runs sandboxes through a local gateway backed by Docker, Podman, or a VM runtime, or through a remote Kubernetes gateway. Every sandbox requires an active gateway:

```bash
openshell gateway add <gateway-url> --name <name>
openshell gateway select <name>

openshell sandbox create --name pi-sandbox --from pi -- pi
```

The whole `pi` process runs inside the sandbox, so built-in tools, `!` commands, and extension tools all execute inside the boundary.

Remote gateways do not bind-mount host project files, so sandbox writes are not reflected on your machine. Clone the repository inside the sandbox or transfer files explicitly:

```bash
openshell sandbox upload pi-sandbox ./repo /workspace
openshell sandbox download pi-sandbox /workspace/repo ./repo-out
```

OpenShell providers can keep raw model API keys outside the sandbox: with inference routing configured, code inside the sandbox calls `https://inference.local` and the gateway injects provider credentials upstream. Point Pi at the corresponding OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible endpoint to use that route.
