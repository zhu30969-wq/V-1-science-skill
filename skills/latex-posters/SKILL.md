# LaTeX Research Posters

## Overview

Research posters are a critical medium for scientific communication at conferences, symposia, and academic events. This skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating professional, visually appealing research posters using LaTeX packages. Generate publication-quality posters with proper layout, typography, color schemes, and visual hierarchy.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Creating research posters for conferences, symposia, or poster sessions
- Designing academic posters for university events or thesis defenses
- Preparing visual summaries of research for public engagement
- Converting scientific papers into poster format
- Creating template posters for research groups or departments
- Designing posters that comply with specific conference size requirements (A0, A1, 36×48", etc.)
- Building posters with complex multi-column layouts
- Integrating figures, tables, equations, and citations in poster format

## AI-Powered Visual Element Generation

**STANDARD WORKFLOW: Generate ALL major visual elements using AI before creating the LaTeX poster.**

This is the recommended approach for creating visually compelling posters:
1. Plan all visual elements needed (title, intro, methods, results, conclusions)
2. Generate each element using scientific-schematics or Nano Banana Pro
3. Assemble generated images in the LaTeX template
4. Add text content around the visuals

**Target: 60-70% of poster area should be AI-generated visuals, 30-40% text.**

### Hard limits (do not exceed)

These are limits, not guidelines. Violating them is the single most common cause of a
failed poster. Full reasoning, per-graphic-type tables, and worked examples are in
[references/ai_graphics_for_posters.md](references/ai_graphics_for_posters.md).

| Constraint | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Elements per AI-generated graphic | **3-4 maximum** (3 ideal) |
| Words per graphic | **10 maximum** |
| White space per graphic | **50% minimum** (60% better) |
| Key numbers / metrics | **120pt+** |
| Labels | **80pt+** |
| Body text on the poster | **24pt+** |
| Content sections (A0) | **5-6 maximum** |
| Total words on the poster | **300-800** |
| Figure width | `0.85\linewidth`, never `1.0` |

Every graphic prompt must include: `POSTER FORMAT for A0`, an explicit element or word
count (`ONLY 3 icons`, `3 words total`), a font size (`GIANT (120pt+)`), `60% white space`,
and a viewing distance (`readable from 10-12 feet`).

**Two mandatory review gates.** Skipping either is how unreadable posters happen:

- **Before generating** — for each planned graphic, confirm it is 3-4 items, one message,
  under 10 words, and not a 5+ stage workflow. If not, split it into several graphics.
- **After generating, before assembly** — open each figure at 25% zoom. All text readable,
  4 or fewer elements, 50%+ white space, understandable in 2 seconds. Any failure means
  regenerate or split. Do not assemble a poster from figures that failed.

Patterns that always fail: `7-stage workflow`, `timeline with annual milestones`,
`3 case studies in one graphic`, `comparison of 5+ methods`, `architecture with all layers`.
Collapse each to 3 high-level items, or make several separate graphics.

**Overflow is an error, not a warning.** After compiling, run `grep -i overfull poster.log`
and inspect all four edges at 100% zoom. See
[references/compilation_and_quality_control.md](references/compilation_and_quality_control.md).

## Scientific Schematics Integration

For detailed guidance on creating schematics, refer to the **scientific-schematics** skill documentation.

**Key capabilities:**
- Nano Banana Pro automatically generates, reviews, and refines diagrams
- Creates publication-quality images with proper formatting
- Ensures accessibility (colorblind-friendly, high contrast)
- Supports iterative refinement for complex diagrams

## Core Capabilities

Three poster packages are supported — **beamerposter** (Beamer syntax, institutional
themes), **tikzposter** (modern, colorful, flexible), and **baposter** (structured
multi-column). Package comparison, layout and grid systems, design principles, standard
sizes, per-package templates, figure and image integration, color schemes, typography,
and QR codes are all documented in
[references/latex_poster_reference.md](references/latex_poster_reference.md).

Reusable per-section content patterns, accessibility requirements, and presentation-day
guidance are in
[references/poster_patterns_and_presentation.md](references/poster_patterns_and_presentation.md).

## Workflow for Poster Creation

### Stage 1: Planning and Content Development

1. **Determine poster requirements**:
   - Conference size specifications (A0, 36×48", etc.)
   - Orientation (portrait vs. landscape)
   - Submission deadlines and format requirements

2. **Develop content outline**:
   - Identify 1-3 core messages
   - Select key figures (typically 3-6 main visuals)
   - Draft concise text for each section (bullet points preferred)
   - Aim for 300-800 words total

3. **Choose LaTeX package**:
   - beamerposter: If familiar with Beamer, need institutional themes
   - tikzposter: For modern, colorful designs with flexibility
   - baposter: For structured, professional multi-column layouts

### Stage 2: Generate Visual Elements (AI-Powered)

**CRITICAL: Generate SIMPLE figures with MINIMAL content. Each graphic = ONE message.**

**Content limits:**
- Maximum 4-5 elements per graphic
- Maximum 15 words total per graphic
- 50% white space minimum
- GIANT fonts (80pt+ for labels, 120pt+ for key numbers)

1. **Create figures directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p figures
   ```

2. **Generate SIMPLE visual elements**:
   ```bash
   # Introduction - ONLY 3 icons/elements
   python scripts/generate_schematic.py "POSTER FORMAT for A0. SIMPLE visual with ONLY 3 elements: [icon1] [icon2] [icon3]. ONE word labels (80pt+). 50% white space. Readable from 8 feet." -o figures/intro.png
   
   # Methods - ONLY 4 steps maximum
   python scripts/generate_schematic.py "POSTER FORMAT for A0. SIMPLE flowchart with ONLY 4 boxes: STEP1 → STEP2 → STEP3 → STEP4. GIANT labels (100pt+). 50% white space. NO sub-steps." -o figures/methods.png
   
   # Results - ONLY 3 bars/comparisons
   python scripts/generate_schematic.py "POSTER FORMAT for A0. SIMPLE chart with ONLY 3 bars. GIANT percentages ON bars (120pt+). NO axis, NO legend. 50% white space." -o figures/results.png
   
   # Conclusions - EXACTLY 3 items with GIANT numbers
   python scripts/generate_schematic.py "POSTER FORMAT for A0. EXACTLY 3 key findings: '[NUMBER]' (150pt) '[LABEL]' (60pt) for each. 50% white space. NO other text." -o figures/conclusions.png
   ```

3. **Review generated figures - check for overflow:**
   - **View at 25% zoom**: All text still readable?
   - **Count elements**: More than 5? → Regenerate simpler
   - **Check white space**: Less than 40%? → Add "60% white space" to prompt
   - **Font too small?**: Add "EVEN LARGER" or increase pt sizes
   - **Still overflowing?**: Reduce to 3 elements instead of 4-5

### Stage 3: Design and Layout

1. **Select or create template**:
   - Start with provided templates in `assets/`
   - Customize color scheme to match branding
   - Configure page size and orientation

2. **Design layout structure**:
   - Plan column structure (2, 3, or 4 columns)
   - Map content flow (typically left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
   - Allocate space for title (10-15%), content (70-80%), footer (5-10%)

3. **Set typography**:
   - Configure font sizes for different hierarchy levels
   - Ensure minimum 24pt body text
   - Test readability from 4-6 feet distance

### Stage 4: Content Integration

1. **Create poster header**:
   - Title (concise, descriptive, 10-15 words)
   - Authors and affiliations
   - Institution logos (high-resolution)
   - Conference logo if required

2. **Integrate AI-generated figures**:
   - Add all figures from Stage 2 to appropriate sections
   - Use `\includegraphics` with proper sizing
   - Ensure figures dominate each section (visuals first, text second)
   - Center figures within blocks for visual impact

3. **Add minimal supporting text**:
   - Keep text minimal and scannable (300-800 words total)
   - Use bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Write in active voice
   - Text should complement figures, not duplicate them

4. **Add supplementary elements**:
   - QR codes for supplementary materials
   - References (cite key papers only, 5-10 typical)
   - Contact information and acknowledgments

### Stage 5: Refinement and Testing

1. **Review and iterate**:
   - Check for typos and errors
   - Verify all figures are high resolution
   - Ensure consistent formatting
   - Confirm color scheme works well together

2. **Test readability**:
   - Print at 25% scale and read from 2-3 feet (simulates poster from 8-12 feet)
   - Check color on different monitors
   - Verify QR codes function correctly
   - Ask colleague to review

3. **Optimize for printing**:
   - Embed all fonts in PDF
   - Verify image resolution
   - Check PDF size requirements
   - Include bleed area if required

### Stage 6: Compilation and Delivery

1. **Compile final PDF**:
   ```bash
   pdflatex poster.tex
   # Or for better font support:
   lualatex poster.tex
   ```

2. **Verify output quality**:
   - Check all elements are visible and correctly positioned
   - Zoom to 100% and inspect figure quality
   - Verify colors match expectations
   - Confirm PDF opens correctly on different viewers

3. **Prepare for printing**:
   - Export as PDF/X-1a if required
   - Save backup copies
   - Get test print on regular paper first
   - Order professional printing 2-3 days before deadline

4. **Create supplementary materials**:
   - Save PNG/JPG version for social media
   - Create handout version (8.5×11" summary)
   - Prepare digital version for email sharing

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works effectively with:
- **Scientific Schematics**: CRITICAL - Use for generating all poster diagrams and flowcharts
- **Generate Image / Nano Banana Pro**: For stylized graphics, conceptual illustrations, and summary visuals
- **Scientific Writing**: For developing poster content from papers
- **Literature Review**: For contextualizing research
- **Data Analysis**: For creating result figures and charts

**Recommended workflow**: Always use scientific-schematics and generate-image skills BEFORE creating the LaTeX poster to generate all visual elements.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**AI-Generated Graphics Mistakes (MOST COMMON):**
- ❌ Too many elements in one graphic (10+ items) → Keep to 3-5 max
- ❌ Text too small in AI graphics → Specify "GIANT (100pt+)" or "HUGE (150pt+)"
- ❌ Too much detail in prompts → Use "SIMPLE" and "ONLY X elements"
- ❌ No white space specification → Add "50% white space" to every prompt
- ❌ Complex flowcharts with 8+ steps → Limit to 4-5 steps maximum
- ❌ Comparison charts with 6+ items → Limit to 3 items maximum
- ❌ Key findings with 5+ metrics → Show only top 3

**Fixing Overflow in AI Graphics:**
If your AI-generated graphics are overflowing or have small text:
1. Add "SIMPLER" or "ONLY 3 elements" to prompt
2. Increase font sizes: "150pt+" instead of "80pt+"
3. Add "60% white space" instead of "50%"
4. Remove sub-details: "NO sub-steps", "NO axis labels", "NO legend"
5. Regenerate with fewer elements

**Design Mistakes**:
- ❌ Too much text (over 1000 words)
- ❌ Font sizes too small (under 24pt body text)
- ❌ Low-contrast color combinations
- ❌ Cluttered layout with no white space
- ❌ Inconsistent styling across sections
- ❌ Poor quality or pixelated images

**Content Mistakes**:
- ❌ No clear narrative or message
- ❌ Too many research questions or objectives
- ❌ Overuse of jargon without definitions
- ❌ Results without context or interpretation
- ❌ Missing author contact information

**Technical Mistakes**:
- ❌ Wrong poster dimensions for conference requirements
- ❌ RGB colors sent to CMYK printer (color shift)
- ❌ Fonts not embedded in PDF
- ❌ File size too large for submission portal
- ❌ QR codes too small or not tested

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Generate SIMPLE AI graphics with 3-5 elements max
- ✅ Use GIANT fonts (100pt+) for key numbers in graphics
- ✅ Specify "50% white space" in every AI prompt
- ✅ Follow conference size specifications exactly
- ✅ Test print at reduced scale before final printing
- ✅ Use high-contrast, accessible color schemes
- ✅ Keep text minimal and highly scannable
- ✅ Include clear contact information and QR codes
- ✅ Proofread carefully (errors are magnified on posters!)
