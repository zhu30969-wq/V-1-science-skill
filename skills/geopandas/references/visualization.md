# Static and interactive visualization

A map is a derived analytical artifact. It can misstate units, hide missing
data, expose exact locations, or contact third-party services even when the
underlying geometry operations are correct.

## Privacy gate

Before plotting:

1. classify coordinates, addresses, trajectories, parcels, facilities, and
   small-area attributes for sensitivity;
2. decide whether the audience needs exact geometry;
3. aggregate, suppress small groups, jitter only with a defensible privacy
   model, or generalize at an appropriate scale;
4. remove direct identifiers and sensitive tooltip/popup fields;
5. inspect the output itself—HTML, SVG, PDF, and GeoJSON can preserve exact
   coordinates or attributes even when the image looks coarse.

The bundled `scripts/sensitive_coordinates_checklist.py` provides a conservative
release gate. It does not claim legal or privacy compliance.

## Static plotting

GeoPandas `.plot()` uses Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
gdf.plot(
    ax=ax,
    column="rate",
    cmap="viridis",
    legend=True,
    missing_kwds={
        "color": "lightgrey",
        "edgecolor": "black",
        "hatch": "///",
        "label": "Missing",
    },
)
ax.set_title("Synthetic rate by region")
ax.set_axis_off()
fig.savefig("derived/map.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
```

Pin Matplotlib and optional mapping dependencies in the project lock. The
GeoPandas 1.1 tagged source tests Matplotlib >=3.7 and mapclassify >=2.5.

### Choropleth correctness

State in the title/caption or metadata:

- variable definition, units, date, and source;
- whether values are counts, rates, densities, or percentages;
- normalization denominator and treatment of zero/missing denominators;
- classification method, number of bins, and explicit boundaries;
- color-map direction and meaning;
- missing/suppressed/out-of-scope styling;
- CRS/projection and any geographic generalization.

Raw counts over unequal polygon areas often communicate population size rather
than rate. Compute an appropriate rate/density first and retain numerator and
denominator.

`scheme=` delegates classification to mapclassify:

```python
ax = gdf.plot(
    column="rate",
    scheme="quantiles",
    k=5,
    cmap="viridis",
    legend=True,
)
```

Quantiles balance feature counts but can place almost equal values in different
bins. Equal intervals can leave sparse bins; natural breaks are data-dependent
and make cross-map comparisons difficult. For comparisons, reuse explicit
boundaries and a common normalization.

### Missing data

GeoPandas ignores missing values by default. That can make missing areas look
like background or water. Always count missing values and use `missing_kwds`
when they are meaningful. Distinguish:

- missing attribute;
- missing geometry;
- empty geometry;
- suppressed value;
- zero;
- outside the study area.

Do not coerce missing values to zero for visual convenience.

### Categorical maps

Use `categorical=True` for categories and a qualitative palette. Verify category
order and legend labels; do not imply magnitude with a sequential palette.
GeoPandas 1.1.4 fixed custom categorical/boolean `legend_kwds={"labels": ...}`
being ignored by `explore()`.

### Layering

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
areas.plot(ax=ax, facecolor="none", edgecolor="0.4", zorder=1)
generalized_points.plot(ax=ax, color="black", markersize=8, zorder=2)
```

- Reproject every layer to a common CRS.
- Use `facecolor="none"` for transparent polygon faces; Python `None` means
  something different.
- Choose `zorder`, alpha, and line width deliberately.
- Confirm no layer is hidden by a filled polygon.
- Keep a stable visual scale when comparing panels.

## Projection and extent

Choose a map projection for the communication goal:

- equal-area for area comparisons;
- local conformal for local shape/angles;
- Web Mercator only when required by a web tile system;
- a suitable global projection for world views.

GeoPandas may set a latitude-dependent aspect for geographic plots, but that is
not a replacement for a chosen projection. Exact metric scale bars require a
projected CRS with known linear units and limited distortion.

Antimeridian-crossing geometries must be split/wrapped before plotting; changing
axis limits does not repair a line drawn across the map.

## Basemaps are network and licensing dependencies

Tile helpers such as contextily and `explore(tiles=...)` can send viewport,
zoom, IP, and timing information to a provider and can disclose the study area.
They also introduce attribution, terms-of-use, caching, availability, and
reproducibility requirements.

Do not fetch tiles automatically. If a user explicitly approves a provider:

- verify its official URL, license, attribution, and usage limits;
- generalize sensitive overlays before the request;
- record provider, style, retrieval date, zoom, and tile hashes/cache;
- do not put credentials in source or generated HTML;
- use a vetted cache for reproducible/offline output where permitted.

## Interactive `explore`

`GeoDataFrame.explore()` returns a `folium.Map`. Background tiles require CRS
metadata and normally cause network requests. Start with a no-tile,
no-attribute local draft:

```python
interactive = generalized_gdf.explore(
    tiles=None,
    tooltip=False,
    popup=False,
    style_kwds={"fillOpacity": 0.5, "weight": 1},
)
interactive.save("derived/local-draft.html")
```

Even `tiles=None` HTML can reference CDN-hosted JavaScript/CSS depending on the
Folium configuration. Inspect the generated HTML and use an approved offline
asset strategy before sensitive or air-gapped use.

Privacy hazards:

- `popup=True` can expose all columns;
- tooltip lists can expose addresses or unique IDs;
- coordinates are embedded in the HTML/GeoJSON;
- layer names and filenames can disclose project context;
- user-added tile URLs can leak tokens and viewport;
- sharing the HTML shares data, not just a screenshot.

For multiple layers, add only generalized/allowlisted columns and explicit
names. Do not use the interactive map as a data-access control boundary.

## Geometry and plotting edge cases

- Empty/missing geometries are not visible; report their counts.
- Invalid polygons can render inconsistently; validate first.
- Mixed geometry types need explicit styles per type.
- Polygon holes and ring orientation should be checked after repair/export.
- Z/M are ignored by 2D plotting.
- Marker size is in display units, not map units, unless explicitly transformed.
- Alpha blending can create misleading dark areas from duplicated/overlapping
  features; audit duplicate geometry and join multiplication.
- Tiny overlay slivers can dominate outlines; fix/audit topology rather than
  merely hiding them.

## Accessibility and honest design

- Prefer perceptually uniform, color-vision-aware palettes.
- Include text labels/patterns when color alone is insufficient.
- Keep legend order, labels, precision, and units consistent with the data.
- Avoid rainbow palettes and excessive classes.
- Use adequate contrast and minimum line/marker sizes.
- Include alt text/caption summarizing the main pattern and missing/suppressed
  data.
- Do not imply uncertainty-free precision; display uncertainty or caveats.

## Reproducible output

Record:

- source/output hashes and privacy/generalization decision;
- package versions, CRS, projection, extent, and antimeridian handling;
- plotted column, normalization, classification/bins, palette, missing style;
- layer order and styling;
- figure size, DPI, and format;
- tile provider/license/retrieval metadata or explicit `tiles=None`;
- tooltip/popup allowlist and HTML external-resource audit.

Raster PNG reduces direct coordinate extraction compared with SVG/HTML but is
not anonymization. Check metadata and visual landmarks before release.
