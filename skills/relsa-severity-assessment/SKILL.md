# RELSA severity assessment and humane endpoint forecasting

## Overview

Severity assessment in animal research is legally mandatory and scientifically load-bearing:
it drives humane endpoint decisions, and poor welfare monitoring degrades reproducibility.
The usual practice evaluates each readout in isolation — weight loss here, a clinical score
there — which makes it hard to say how badly an individual animal is actually doing.

This skill implements two published procedures that address that:

- **RELSA** (Talbot et al., 2022) combines several outcome measures into one score per animal
  per time point, expressed *relative to a reference set of known burden*. RELSA = 0 is
  baseline; RELSA = 1 means the animal has reached the reference set's maximum deviation.
- **foRcast** (Lutscher et al., 2026) fits an ARIMA model to an individual animal's RELSA
  trajectory and forecasts the next score with a 95% prediction interval, so animals heading
  for a humane endpoint can be identified before they get there. Kernel density estimation on
  the RELSA scale supplies candidate *attention* and *danger* zones for interpretation.

The point is **refinement**: give at-risk animals attention earlier, and avoid euthanising
animals that would have recovered. Both procedures are aids to severity assessment, not
decision rules — see [Boundaries](#boundaries-state-these-when-you-report).

## When to use this skill

- Combining weight loss, temperature, clinical scoring, biomarkers, or telemetry into a single
  per-animal severity score
- Asking which animals in a cohort are at risk of reaching a humane endpoint, or predicting
  the severity score at a coming time point
- Comparing severity between treatment groups, interventions, or animal models on a common
  relative scale
- Defining thresholds or zones on a severity scale from the data
- Writing the severity-assessment section of an animal welfare report, a 3Rs/refinement
  analysis, or an application under EU Directive 2010/63/EU

For general forecasting of a time series that is not a severity score, use
**timesfm-forecasting** or **statsmodels**. For study design and sample size, use
**experimental-design** and **statistical-power**.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install "numpy>=1.26" "pandas>=2.0" "scipy>=1.11" "statsmodels>=0.14" matplotlib
```

`relsa_score.py` and `kde_thresholds.py` need only numpy/pandas/scipy; statsmodels is required
for forecasting and matplotlib only for figures.

## Data format

One row per animal per time point, in a CSV:

| id | treatment | condition | day | temp | weight | score | il6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | treated | endpoint | -1 | 37.15 | 25.17 | 0 | 35.1 |
| M01 | treated | endpoint | 0 | 37.26 | 25.25 | 0 | 39.5 |
| M01 | treated | endpoint | 1 | 35.83 | 23.12 | 4 | 162.0 |

- `id` and a time column (`day`, `time`, `hour`, …) are required; `treatment` and `condition`
  are optional labels used for grouping and for selecting the reference set.
- Time may be days, hours, or minutes — just keep it monotonic per animal. The RELSA
  convention codes the baseline time point as `-1`.
- **One row per animal per time point.** Average hourly telemetry to one value per interval
  first (the published models average heart rate, HRV, and temperature, and sum activity).
- Leave missing measurements empty. They are dropped from the score, never imputed — a
  missing value treated as "no deviation" biases severity downward.

`assets/example_cohort.csv` is a small synthetic cohort (6 mice, 9 days, temperature, body
weight, an 0–8 clinical score, and an IL-6-like biomarker) used by every command below, so
each one is runnable as written.

## The four decisions that determine the result

Make these explicitly and write them into the methods. Nothing else about the procedure
matters as much.

**1. Directionality — which variables rise under worsening?** Falling is the default (body
weight, activity, food intake, burrowing, wheel running). Variables that *rise* must be
declared as `--turned`: clinical scores, inflammatory biomarkers, fever, tachycardia. Get
this wrong and the variable contributes nothing at all, silently, because deviations in the
"wrong" direction are floored at zero. Body temperature is model-dependent — it *falls* in
sepsis and endotoxaemia, *rises* in fever models. Nothing in the data can settle this for you:
in the published sepsis model activity legitimately swings further above baseline than below,
so only a variable that *never once* moves the declared way is detectable, and
`build_reference()` warns about exactly that case.

**2. The reference set — relative to what?** RELSA scores mean nothing without it. Use the
group assumed to carry the greatest burden in your model (the published studies use the
highest-dose or endpoint-reaching treatment group). Too mild a reference pushes every score
above 1; too severe compresses everything toward 0. Save it with `--save-reference` and reuse
it with `--load-reference` so later cohorts stay on the same scale.

**3. Scores with a zero baseline.** A clinical score of 0 in a healthy animal cannot be
ratio-normalized — `0/0` is undefined. Use `--score-scale score=8` to map the score's scale
instead (healthy → 100%, worst possible → 200%), which also marks it as turned. This mapping
is a modelling choice about how much one score point is worth relative to one percent of body
weight; state it. The alternative is to keep the score out of RELSA and use it as an
independent endpoint criterion.

**4. Which variables are measured throughout.** Because the score averages over whichever
variables are available, a variable that appears or disappears mid-trajectory moves the score
by itself. In the published sepsis data, adding body weight — recorded only on the day of
euthanasia — drops that animal's endpoint score from 0.93 to 0.83 for no biological reason.
`relsa_scores()` warns when composition changes; score the variables present throughout.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — compute RELSA scores

```bash
python scripts/relsa_score.py assets/example_cohort.csv \
    --variables weight,temp,score,il6 \
    --normalize weight,temp,il6 \
    --turned il6 \
    --score-scale score=8 \
    --baseline-time -1 \
    --reference-group condition=endpoint \
    --save-reference reference.json \
    --out relsa_scores.csv
```

The reference model is echoed so the scale is auditable:

```
reference model: assets/example_cohort.csv [condition=endpoint]
  animals=2  rows=18  baseline_time=-1.0
  variable      turned   max reached   max delta
  weight            no         82.40       17.60
  temp              no         92.79        7.21
  score            yes        187.50       87.50
  il6              yes        797.72      697.72
```

`relsa_scores.csv` holds each variable's weight alongside the score, which is what makes a
score explainable — here M01 deteriorating to its endpoint, M03 peaking on day 3 and
recovering:

```
 id  time  weight  temp  score  il6  n_vars  relsa
M01     1    0.46  0.49   0.57 0.52       4   0.51
M01     3    0.84  0.76   1.00 0.89       4   0.88
M01     5    1.00  1.00   1.00 1.00       4   1.00
M03     3    0.56  0.44   0.57 0.54       4   0.53
M03     5    0.35  0.26   0.43 0.32       4   0.35
M03     7    0.12  0.06   0.14 0.11       4   0.11
```

A weight of 1.00 means that variable hit the reference maximum; `n_vars` is how many
variables entered the score at that time point.

Same thing from Python, when you need the objects:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from _common import read_relsa_table, score_to_percent
from relsa_score import prepare, build_reference, relsa_scores

frame = read_relsa_table("assets/example_cohort.csv")
frame["score"] = score_to_percent(frame["score"], max_score=8)   # 0-8 clinical score
VARS, TURNED = ["weight", "temp", "score", "il6"], ["score", "il6"]

prepared  = prepare(frame, normalize=["weight", "temp", "il6"], baseline_time=-1)
reference = build_reference(prepared[prepared.condition == "endpoint"],
                           variables=VARS, turned=TURNED, baseline_time=-1,
                           label="endpoint-reaching animals")
scores    = relsa_scores(prepared, reference)
```

### Step 2 — forecast the endpoint

Train on everything up to the time point *before* the endpoint, predict the score at the
endpoint, and score the prediction:

```bash
python scripts/forecast_relsa.py relsa_scores.csv \
    --animals M01,M02 --endpoints M01=5 --endpoints M02=6 \
    --group-col condition --plot-dir figs --endpoint-line 1.0
```

```
 id  time  predicted    lower    upper        model  actual
M01   5.0   0.932585 0.670443 1.194728 ARIMA(1,1,0)    1.00
M02   6.0   0.955696 0.748309 1.163084 ARIMA(1,1,0)    0.94

   group             id        model  n   rmse  picp  mpiw
endpoint            M01 ARIMA(1,1,0)  1 0.0674 100.0 0.524
endpoint            M02 ARIMA(1,1,0)  1 0.0157 100.0 0.415
endpoint -- endpoint --               2 0.0489 100.0 0.470
                OVERALL               2 0.0489 100.0 0.470
```

Report all three metrics together. **RMSE** is point accuracy, **PICP** the percentage of
actual values inside the interval, and **MPIW** the mean interval width in RELSA units — a
model can reach PICP = 100% by making the interval so wide it says nothing, which is exactly
what the paper's pancreatic cancer row (PICP 100%, MPIW 7.35, i.e. 735% of the RELSA range)
shows.

For live monitoring, forecast one step ahead at every time point instead:

```bash
python scripts/forecast_relsa.py relsa_scores.csv --mode rolling --animals M03
```

Two things to know before trusting a forecast:

- **Interpolation is on by default** (`--interpolate-step 0.1`), because one measurement per
  day is far too sparse for ARIMA. It buys usable model selection and narrower intervals at
  the cost of honest uncertainty. Set `--interpolate-step 0` when measurement frequency
  allows.
- **ARIMA cannot predict a cliff.** It assumes stationarity and linearity, so an abrupt
  collapse in the last hours before an endpoint will not be forecast from a smooth prior
  trajectory — the paper's own failure case. Act on the *upper* bound of the interval, and
  never let a low forecast override an animal that looks unwell.

### Step 3 — put the score in context with severity zones

```bash
python scripts/kde_thresholds.py relsa_scores.csv \
    --group treatment=treated --n-thresholds 2 --plot zones.png --json zones.json
```

```
KDE on 33 RELSA scores  (bandwidth = 0.1502)
  candidate thresholds (density minima): 0.703
  density modes: 0.264, 0.866
  normal    [0.000, 0.703)  n=25 (75.8%)
  danger    >= 0.703  n=8 (24.2%)
```

Thresholds are the *minima* of the score density — the sparse valleys between clusters of
scores. Include endpoint animals, survivors, and shams: the zones are meant to separate
those states, so all of them must be represented.

**Check the bandwidth before believing a threshold.** On the published sepsis data this
implementation finds minima at 0.355 and 0.655 (published: 0.337 and 0.643) — but a 10%
larger bandwidth removes both minima entirely. Run the sweep in
`references/thresholds-and-zones.md` and report the sweep, not a bare pair of numbers. An
empty threshold list is a legitimate answer: the scores form one cluster and there is no
data-driven place to cut.

## Boundaries: state these when you report

- **RELSA is an aid to severity assessment, not a decisive parameter.** An animal with a low
  RELSA score that shows other signs of distress must still be handled accordingly. Neither
  procedure is a validated predictor of death.
- **KDE zones are not regulatory severity gradings.** EU Directive 2010/63/EU's categories
  (non-recovery, mild, moderate, severe) are assigned prospectively by a different process.
  The paper is explicit that its thresholds "should not be confused with regulatory severity
  gradings" and are not directly translatable to them.
- **Scores are not comparable across reference sets or models.** RELSA is relative by
  construction, and clinical scoring is not harmonized between laboratories. Always report
  the reference set with the score.
- **The published evidence is a proof of concept**: 13 animals across seven models, five of
  those rows resting on one or two animals. The overall RMSE of 0.069 and PICP of 96% come
  from 13 endpoint predictions.
- **An underestimated score is the dangerous error**, because it discourages attention and can
  delay a euthanasia decision, whereas an overestimate merely prompts extra care.

## Reporting checklist

A severity analysis is reproducible only if all of this is stated:

1. Outcome measures, their units, and their **directionality** (which were turned, and why).
2. The **baseline** time point or window, and which variables were normalized.
3. Any **score mapping** applied to ordinal variables, with its scale.
4. The **reference set**: which animals, which group, how many, and why they are assumed to
   carry the greatest burden.
5. Humane endpoint criteria actually applied in the study, separately from the RELSA score.
6. For forecasts: interpolation step, the selected ARIMA order per animal, and RMSE, PICP,
   *and* MPIW.
7. For thresholds: the bandwidth, the number of scores, and a bandwidth sensitivity sweep.
8. Software versions, and the statement that thresholds are model-specific and not regulatory
   gradings.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Wrong directionality** — a rising variable not listed in `--turned` contributes exactly
   zero, silently, and no warning is possible unless it never once falls. Check the reference
   model table yourself: `max reached` should be below 100 for a falling variable and above 100
   for a turned one, and `max delta` should be a plausible size for that measure.
2. **Normalizing a percentage twice** — `bwc [%]` and mapped scores are already on the percent
   scale; passing them to `--normalize` flattens them.
3. **A zero baseline** — a clinical score of 0 makes the ratio undefined; the variable becomes
   all-NaN with a warning. Use `--score-scale`.
4. **A reference set that does not express the burden** — a variable that never deviates in it
   raises an error rather than dividing by zero, and one that barely deviates inflates every
   score.
5. **Changing variable composition along a trajectory** — see decision 4 above.
6. **Reading MPIW as a good thing** — a wide interval raises PICP while destroying the
   forecast's usefulness.
7. **Reporting a KDE threshold without its bandwidth** — thresholds can vanish under a 10%
   bandwidth change.
8. **Treating the forecast as permission to wait** — the model cannot see abrupt
   deterioration, and the humane endpoint criteria of the protocol always take precedence.
9. **Comparing RELSA scores between models** — only valid within one reference frame.
