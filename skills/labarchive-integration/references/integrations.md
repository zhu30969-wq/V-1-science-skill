# Official LabArchives Integrations

Verified against the official help-center integration section on
**2026-07-23**:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/sections/11732611360660-Integrations

The current index lists:

- External Integrations Overview
- GraphPad Prism
- SnapGene
- Geneious
- Proofig AI
- Jupyter
- REDCap
- Protocols.io
- Qeios
- SciSpace
- Vernier Logger Pro
- DataCite

Availability can depend on product, license, regional server, institutional
policy, and administrator configuration. Check the exact article and local
approval before moving research data.

## Integration is not a generic API contract

An advertised integration may be:

- a file upload/viewer,
- a vendor-side export,
- a locally installed external module,
- a product-specific account connection,
- or a LabArchives UI feature.

Do not convert those workflows into guessed ELN methods, Inventory routes, or
OAuth endpoints. The official sources reviewed do not establish generic
`/oauth/authorize` or `/oauth/token` endpoints, client-ID scopes, refresh tokens,
or a universal LabArchives OAuth 2.0 flow.

The legacy ELN API has a documented **OAuth-like API user-login redirect** using
`/api_user_login`, a signed redirect URI, an authorization code, and
`users::user_access_info`. That is a separate API authorization mechanism; see
[`authentication_guide.md`](authentication_guide.md).

## Jupyter

Official article, updated **2025-09-08**:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/articles/11780569021972-Jupyter-Integration

Verified behavior:

- Upload an `.ipynb` as an Attachment Entry or by drag-and-drop.
- LabArchives shows a preview and opens the file in its Docs Viewer.
- Edit the notebook locally and upload a replacement to change its contents.
- Page revisions retain prior uploaded versions.
- Viewer annotations are not included in revision history.

This is an attachment/viewer workflow, not evidence of a live Jupyter kernel,
two-way synchronization, or an API-specific notebook-entry type. Preserve the
original `.ipynb`; consider attaching an environment lock/export separately
according to institutional policy.

## REDCap

Official article, updated **2025-09-05**:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/articles/11780613160980-REDCap-Integration

Verified behavior:

- Mass General Brigham's REDCap team developed the **MGB LabArchives** External
  Module.
- An institution's REDCap administrators install and configure it.
- A user connects with the email matching their LabArchives account and a
  LabArchives temporary token in place of a password.
- The module uploads selected REDCap reports to a chosen owned notebook.
- The feature may be unavailable or unapproved at an organization.

This is not a generic “sync all REDCap data” API. Before upload, select the exact
report and remove/de-identify data as required. Never claim that the integration
itself makes a workflow HIPAA- or 21 CFR Part 11-compliant.

The help article links the module source:
https://github.com/PHSERIS/redcap_lab_archives_em

Treat it as a separate community/institutional dependency. Review and pin the
approved release/commit through the REDCap administrator rather than installing
it from this skill.

## Protocols.io

Official article, updated **2025-09-22**:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/articles/11780572389524-Protocols-io-Integration

Verified behavior:

- Connection starts in Protocols.io under **Settings > Apps > LabArchives**.
- The user selects the correct LabArchives regional server.
- A connected user can export a protocol or protocol run record.
- The result is saved in the LabArchives notebook as a PDF.
- SSO users may need a LabArchives temporary token.
- The connection remains active until deactivated in Protocols.io.

Do not replace this supported vendor workflow with a fabricated
`entries::create_entry` script or assume HTML, comments, versions, or metadata
are synchronized beyond what the article states.

## GraphPad Prism

Official article:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/articles/11780457243668-GraphPad-Prism

Follow the supported Prism/LabArchives UI workflow from that page. Do not post
Prism files to an inferred attachment endpoint or place Access Passwords in
multipart form fields. Verify supported Prism versions and behavior from the
current article at implementation time.

## SnapGene

Official article:
https://help.labarchives.com/hc/en-us/articles/11780512729492-SnapGene-Integration

Use the documented SnapGene/LabArchives connection and file behavior. Do not
assume a SnapGene CLI exists, generate previews through an undocumented command,
or infer supported file extensions from old examples.

## Geneious and other indexed integrations

Use the current help-center index to open the exact article for Geneious,
Proofig AI, Qeios, SciSpace, Vernier Logger Pro, or DataCite. The presence of a
name in the index verifies an official help topic, not a programmable API or
bidirectional synchronization capability.

For every integration:

1. Identify where the connection is configured.
2. Confirm the user's region and organizational approval.
3. Record what data leaves each system and in which direction.
4. Determine whether the operation stores a copy, link, preview, or live
   connection.
5. Use temporary tokens only through the documented product UI and never store
   them in scripts.
6. Test with non-sensitive data in an approved test notebook.
7. Verify the resulting file/object and revision behavior.

## Custom integration boundary

Only build a custom integration when the official product workflow does not
meet the requirement and API access has been approved.

- For ELN data, select a method from the current official ELN class tree.
- For Inventory, select an exact `/public/v1/...` page.
- Keep source-system authentication separate from LabArchives authentication.
- Use a redacted dry run for every remote write.
- Set explicit timeouts, serialize/stagger batch calls, and bound eligible
  retries.
- Log operation IDs and non-sensitive outcomes, never credentials, signatures,
  query strings, temporary tokens, or research content.
- Validate file paths, content type, size, and classification locally before
  transfer.

Do not present hypothetical integration templates as vendor-supported behavior.
