# LabArchives Authentication and Regions

Verified against official public sources on **2026-07-23**. LabArchives may
provide additional institution-specific development documentation with API
credentials; that documentation controls when it differs from this summary.

## Access prerequisites

### ELN

The official ELN subscription guide (updated 2025-09-24) lists developer API
access as an Enterprise capability. An Access Key ID and Access Password are
issued by LabArchives for a specific organization/vendor and intended purpose.
They are not ordinary account credentials.

### Inventory API v1

The Inventory FAQ (updated 2026-05-19) states that API access is available only
to Enterprise and Enterprise Plus licensees. The caller must:

- have a LabArchives account,
- have an Inventory account,
- be given API access, and
- remain subject to Inventory application access rights.

An eligible Inventory license member can request access through
`support@labarchives.com`.

## Credential types

Keep these values distinct:

- **Access Key ID (`akid`)** — identifies the API client.
- **Access Password** — secret HMAC-SHA-512 key; it is never sent as an API
  parameter or request-body field.
- **UID** — user ID scoped to the Access Key ID that obtained it. It is
  persistent until revoked, but it is not portable across API keys.
- **Authorization code** — short-lived value returned by the API user-login
  flow and redeemed promptly through `users::user_access_info`.
- **Temporary password token** — user-generated alternative accepted as the
  `password` parameter by `users::user_access_info`.
- **Inventory Lab ID** — identifies the current Inventory lab and is documented
  as `X-LabArchives-LabId`.

Do not use a normal LabArchives account password in API scripts.

## Regional browser and ELN API hosts

The two host types are intentionally shown in separate columns. Login URLs come
from the help-center SSO article updated **2025-11-04**; API URLs come from the
official ELN API overview updated **2025-11-03**.

| Region | Browser login | ELN API URL |
|---|---|---|
| US and rest of world | `https://mynotebook.labarchives.com` | `https://api.labarchives.com/api` |
| Canada | `https://ca-mynotebook.labarchives.com` | `https://caapi.labarchives.com/api` |
| Australia/New Zealand | `https://au-mynotebook.labarchives.com` | `https://auapi.labarchives.com/api` |
| United Kingdom | `https://uk-mynotebook.labarchives.com` | `https://ukapi.labarchives.com/api` |
| Europe outside the UK | `https://eu-mynotebook.labarchives.com` | `https://euapi.labarchives.com/api` |

The official ELN overview recommends `utilities::api_base_urls` for distributed
applications so they can discover future regional API additions. The bundled
validator intentionally pins the five hosts documented at this refresh date.

### Inventory absolute base URLs

The public Inventory authentication and endpoint pages reviewed here document
relative `/public/v1/...` paths and required headers. They did **not** establish
a complete regional absolute API base-URL table. Inventory browser hosts are not
proof of API hosts. Use the base URL supplied with the institution/vendor API
documentation; do not derive one from a login URL.

## Named environment variables

These names are conventions used by this skill's local helpers:

```text
LABARCHIVES_ELN_API_URL
LABARCHIVES_ACCESS_KEY_ID
LABARCHIVES_ACCESS_PASSWORD
LABARCHIVES_USER_ID
LABARCHIVES_INVENTORY_LAB_ID
```

Use a shell session, OS keychain, workload secret store, or institution-approved
secret manager to populate them. The scripts:

- inspect only these exact names,
- never walk parent directories for `.env`,
- never write secret files, and
- never print credential values.

Validate presence and endpoint selection:

```bash
uv run scripts/setup_config.py check
uv run scripts/setup_config.py check \
  --require-user-id --require-inventory-lab-id
```

`--prompt-missing-secret` uses `getpass` for a missing Access Password and keeps
the value in memory only. It does not save or authenticate it.

## ELN API user authorization

The official page describes an **OAuth-like** redirect flow. It does not
document generic OAuth 2.0 client credentials, `/oauth/authorize`, or
`/oauth/token` endpoints.

1. Select the user's correct regional API host.
2. Redirect the user to the host's `/api_user_login` path with `akid`,
   `expires`, `sig`, and `redirect_uri`.
3. For this special signature, use the exact **unencoded redirect URI** in place
   of the normal API method name.
4. LabArchives performs account/SSO login and redirects back with `auth_code`
   and `email`.
5. Promptly call the documented `users::user_access_info`, passing the
   authorization code as its `password` parameter and the returned email.
6. Store the resulting UID only in approved secure state. It remains bound to
   the Access Key ID and can be revoked.

If redirects cannot be used, the official flow allows a user-generated
temporary password token in the same `password` parameter. Handle it with
`getpass` or a secure UI field; never put it on a command line or in a log.

Official user-login page (updated 2023-03-03):

## Request signing

The official call-authentication page (updated 2023-05-10) defines:

```text
message = AccessKeyID + api_method_input + expires
signature = Base64(HMAC-SHA-512(key=AccessPassword, message=message))
```

There are no separators. `expires` is current epoch milliseconds, corrected for
server clock skew when needed—not a future token lifetime. The official page
allows two minutes for latency/minor clock synchronization, while the
best-practices page recommends `utilities::epoch_time` for unreliable clocks.

- **ELN ordinary call:** `api_method_input` is the method name only, without its
  class.
- **ELN user-login redirect:** it is the unencoded redirect URI.
- **Inventory v1:** it is the exact relative route, including resolved path
  parameters and excluding the query string.

Official signing page:
https://mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/LabArchives%20API/Ny44fDI3LzYvVHJlZU5vZGUvMTE1MzU5MTAyNXwxOS44

Use `scripts/entry_operations.py self-test` to check the implementation against
the official published test vector without credentials or network access.

## TLS and secret handling

- Permit only `https`.
- Never disable certificate or hostname validation.
- If an institutional interception proxy is required, use its approved CA
  bundle and keep hostname verification enabled.
- Reject credentials embedded in URLs and reject redirects to unapproved hosts.
- Do not log full ELN URLs after signing; authentication appears in the query.
- Do not log Inventory authentication headers.
- Do not include the Access Password in query parameters, headers, form data, or
  JSON. It is an HMAC key only.
- Rotate/revoke credentials through LabArchives after suspected exposure.

## Troubleshooting checklist

1. Confirm API access is enabled for the exact product and account.
2. Confirm the browser account and API host belong to the same region.
3. Confirm the UID was obtained with the same Access Key ID now in use.
4. Confirm the local clock or `epoch_time` adjustment.
5. Confirm the signing input: method-only for ELN, exact relative route for
   Inventory, unencoded redirect URI for user login.
6. Confirm URL encoding is applied only after Base64 for the ELN `sig`.
7. Confirm Inventory path parameters are resolved and query parameters excluded
   from its signature.
8. Report status, official API error code, and a redacted response to support.
   Never include signatures, authorization codes, tokens, or passwords.
