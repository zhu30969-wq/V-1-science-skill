# Imaging Data Commons

## Overview

Query and download public cancer imaging data from the National Cancer Institute Imaging Data Commons (IDC). No authentication required for data access.

**Expected network access:** IDC metadata is reachable three ways — a local DuckDB index shipped with the `idc-index` Python package (no network), or the hosted IDC service over MCP or REST (`api.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov`, no authentication). File downloads use public GCS (`storage.googleapis.com`) and AWS S3 (`s3.amazonaws.com`) — no authentication required. DICOMweb access uses either the public IDC proxy (`proxy.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov`, no auth) or the Google Cloud Healthcare API (`healthcare.googleapis.com`, requires GCP authentication). Optional BigQuery queries (`bigquery.googleapis.com`) also require GCP authentication. No credentials or environment variables are accessed by this skill.

**Current IDC Data Version: v24** (always verify — see *Best Practices*)

**Choose the access path first.** There is no single default: the cheapest correct path depends
on the session and the task.

1. **Session already has the IDC MCP server?** Route discovery and metadata there — see *IDC
   MCP Server*.
2. **Otherwise, is `idc-index` installed?** Run `python scripts/check_version.py`. If it passes,
   use `idc-index` for everything.
3. **Not installed, and the task is read-only metadata** — counts, attribute values, collection
   lookups, SQL under 10 000 rows, licenses, citations, viewer URLs? **Use the REST API over
   `curl`; do not install anything.** Installing costs ~77 MB of packaged index data plus
   pandas, pyarrow, and duckdb, which a metadata question does not need. See *Data Access
   Options*.
4. **Not installed, and the task needs more than metadata** — downloading files, pandas or
   plotting, pydicom/SimpleITK, pathology tiling, results past 10 000 rows, or a version-pinned
   script the user re-runs? Install `idc-index`: `check_version.py` exits non-zero and prints
   the exact install command for the running interpreter. Prefer a virtual environment, then
   restart Python.

`idc-index` ([GitHub](https://github.com/imagingdatacommons/idc-index)) is still the most
capable path and the only one that moves image bytes; the rule is just not to pay for it before
the task calls for it. `check_version.py` never installs anything itself — it also flags a newer
`idc-index` or skill release when one exists.

**Setup for the `idc-index` path:**

```python
from idc_index import IDCClient
client = IDCClient()

# Verify IDC data version (should be "v24")
print(f"IDC data version: {client.get_idc_version()}")
```

**Core workflow:** query metadata with `client.sql_query()` → download with
`client.download_from_selection()` → visualize with `client.get_viewer_URL()`. Python examples
below assume this `client`; *Data Access Options* has the REST equivalents. For current data
scale, run the summary query in `references/sql_patterns.md` or `GET /v3/stats`.

## IDC MCP Server

IDC operates a hosted MCP server at `https://api.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/mcp`
(streamable HTTP, no authentication). Where it is available it complements — it does not
replace — the `idc-index` workflow below.

**Identify it** by the MCP resource `idc://guide`, or by three or more of the tool names
`build_cohort`, `get_cohort_urls`, `list_analysis_results`, and `get_idc_version`. Generic
names such as `run_sql` are not evidence on their own. If identification is ambiguous, use
`idc-index`.

**If this session has the server**, treat it as authoritative for discovery and metadata —
IDC version, counts, attribute values, cohort building, metadata SQL — and follow the
server's own instructions rather than re-deriving them from this file. Its data version is
whatever the server reports: call `get_idc_version` instead of relying on the version pinned
in this file.

Return here for what the server does not do: downloading files, local pandas/notebook
analysis, DICOMweb, BigQuery, digital pathology tiling, and reproducible scripts. Hand off by
passing SeriesInstanceUIDs from the server to `client.download_from_selection(...)`, and run
`scripts/check_version.py` at that point.

**If it is not available**, the identical service is reachable with no configuration as a REST
API at `https://api.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/v3` — use it for read-only metadata rather
than installing `idc-index`, per the routing gate in *Overview*. Suggest connecting the MCP
server at most once, only for repeated interactive discovery, and never change the user's
configuration yourself.

See `references/mcp_guide.md` for the tool inventory, handoff patterns, and per-host notes.

## When to Use This Skill

- Finding publicly available radiology (CT, MR, PET) or pathology (slide microscopy) images
- Selecting image subsets by cancer type, modality, anatomical site, or other metadata
- Downloading DICOM data from IDC
- Checking data licenses before use in research or commercial applications
- Visualizing medical images in a browser without local DICOM viewer software

## IDC Data Model

IDC adds two grouping levels above the standard DICOM hierarchy (Patient → Study → Series → Instance):

- **collection_id**: Groups patients by disease, modality, or research focus (e.g., `tcga_luad`, `nlst`). A patient belongs to exactly one collection.
- **analysis_result_id**: Identifies derived objects (segmentations, annotations, radiomics features) across one or more original collections. Use it to find AI-generated or expert annotations, while `collection_id` finds original imaging data (which may itself include deposited annotations).

**Key identifiers for queries:**
| Identifier | Scope | Use for |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `collection_id` | Dataset grouping | Filtering by project/study |
| `PatientID` | Patient | Grouping images by patient |
| `StudyInstanceUID` | DICOM study | Grouping of related series, visualization |
| `SeriesInstanceUID` | DICOM series | Grouping of related series, visualization |

## Index Tables

The `idc-index` package provides multiple metadata index tables, accessible via SQL or as pandas DataFrames. The REST API exposes the same tables through `GET /tables` and `POST /sql`.

**Important:** `client.indices_overview` is the authoritative source for current table descriptions, available columns, and their types — query it when writing SQL or exploring data structure. It also answers "which table contains column X"; see `references/index_tables_guide.md` for that search pattern and full schema discovery.

### Available Tables

Always call `client.fetch_index("table_name")` before querying any index table — it is safe and idempotent for all tables, including those loaded automatically at startup.

| Family | Tables | Granularity |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Core | `index` (primary metadata for all current data), `collections_index`, `analysis_results_index` | series / collection / analysis result |
| Modality acquisition parameters | `ct_index`, `mr_index`, `pt_index`, `contrast_index` | 1 row = 1 series of that modality |
| Derived objects | `seg_index`, `rtstruct_index`, `ann_index`, `ann_group_index` | 1 row = 1 series (or annotation group) |
| Microscopy | `sm_index`, `sm_instance_index` | 1 row = 1 SM series / instance |
| Geometry, clinical, history | `volume_geometry_index`, `clinical_index`, `version_metadata_index`, `prior_versions_index` | see guide |

`references/index_tables_guide.md` has the full inventory with each table's columns and
contents — load it when you need to know what a specialized table actually holds.

**`prior_versions_index` is for reproducibility only.** It contains series permanently *removed*
from IDC, with zero overlap with `index`. Use it only to reproduce work against a prior IDC
version. Do NOT use it for version history or "what's new" questions — those use
`series_init_idc_version` / `series_revised_idc_version` in the main `index` table, which are
not equivalent to this table's `min_idc_version` / `max_idc_version`.

### Joining Tables

**`SeriesInstanceUID` is the universal join key** for all series-level specialized tables: `sm_index`, `sm_instance_index`, `seg_index`, `ann_index`, `ann_group_index`, `contrast_index`, `volume_geometry_index`, `rtstruct_index`, `ct_index`, `mr_index`, `pt_index`. Always join these to `index` on `SeriesInstanceUID`. The exceptions below use different column names.

| Join Column | Tables | Use Case |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| `collection_id` | index, prior_versions_index, collections_index, clinical_index | Link series to collection metadata or clinical data |
| `analysis_result_id` | index, analysis_results_index | Link series to analysis result metadata (annotations, segmentations) |
| `source_DOI` | index, analysis_results_index | Link by publication DOI |
| `segmented_SeriesInstanceUID` | seg_index → index | Link segmentation to its source image series (`seg_index.segmented_SeriesInstanceUID = index.SeriesInstanceUID`) |
| `referenced_SeriesInstanceUID` | ann_index → index, rtstruct_index → index | Link annotation or RTSTRUCT to its source image series |

**Note:** `subjects`, `updated`, and `description` appear in multiple tables but have different meanings (counts vs identifiers, different update contexts). Joining `prior_versions_index` to `index` on `SeriesInstanceUID` always returns zero rows — see the warning above.

For detailed join examples, schema discovery patterns, key columns reference, and DataFrame access, see `references/index_tables_guide.md`.

### Clinical Data Access

Clinical (non-imaging) attributes — staging, demographics, therapy — live in per-collection
tables. `client.fetch_index("clinical_index")` loads the dictionary mapping columns to
collections; `client.get_clinical_table(name)` returns one table as a DataFrame.

See `references/clinical_data_guide.md` for the discovery workflow, coded-value mapping, and
joining clinical data with imaging.

## Data Access Options

| Method | Auth | Best For | Reference |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|
| `idc-index` | No | Downloads, pandas analysis, unbounded queries — the most capable path | This document |
| IDC MCP server | No | Discovery, cohort building, metadata when the session already has it | `mcp_guide.md` |
| IDC REST API | No | Metadata with no install, from any language or shell — the default when `idc-index` is absent | `rest_api_guide.md` |
| Direct Parquet (GCS) | No | Version-pinned queries, or results past the REST row cap | `parquet_access_guide.md` |
| Cloud storage (S3/GCS) | No | Direct file access, bulk transfer, custom pipelines | `cloud_storage_guide.md` |
| DICOMweb via IDC proxy | No | Tool and PACS integration; daily quota, so testing and moderate use | `dicomweb_guide.md` |
| DICOMweb via Google Healthcare | Yes (GCP) | The same DICOMweb API at production volume, without the proxy quota | `dicomweb_guide.md` |
| SlicerIDCBrowser | No | 3D visualization and analysis in 3D Slicer | https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/SlicerIDCBrowser |
| BigQuery | Yes (GCP) | Full DICOM metadata, private elements, SR measurements — last resort | `bigquery_guide.md` |

**The IDC Portal (https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/) is interactive only** —
browser-based exploration, manual cohort selection, and download. Unlike every option above it
has no programmatic interface, so point a user there to browse or click through data
themselves; never use it as a step in a script or workflow.

**REST API — the no-install metadata path**

`https://api.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/v3`, no authentication: discovery, cohort counts and
manifests, read-only SQL, clinical tables, viewer URLs, licenses, citations. It is the same
service as the MCP server over plain HTTP, so it needs no configuration. It never moves image
bytes — switch to `idc-index` to download, to get a DataFrame, or for results past 10 000 rows.

```bash
B=https://api.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/v3
curl -s $B/version   # idc_version, idc_index_data_version, api_version
curl -s $B/stats     # collections, patients, studies, series, instances, size_TB
curl -s "$B/attributes/Modality/values?limit=5"   # real filter values, with counts
curl -s $B/sql -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sql":"SELECT collection_id, COUNT(*) n FROM index GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY n DESC LIMIT 3"}'
curl -s $B/cohort/counts -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"filters":{"terms":{"collection_id":["rider_pilot"]}}}'
```

**The filter object always goes under `filters`** — on `cohort/counts`, `cohort/manifest`,
`cohort/manifest.txt`, `licenses`, and `citations` alike. A bare filter or an unrecognized key is
a 422 naming the fix; an unfiltered series-enumerating request is a 400, not the whole archive.
Every filtered response echoes `filters_applied` and `warnings` — read them, because they name
any predicate the server dropped. A zero count with empty `warnings` therefore means the filter
matched nothing, not that a value was miscased; miscasing produces a warning that says so.

`POST /sql` takes one read-only `SELECT`/`WITH` over the tables `idc-index` exposes plus
`clinical.<table>`; `max_rows` defaults to 5 000, caps at 10 000, and `truncated` flags clipping.
`GET /attributes` lists the 19 filterable attributes — clinical values, segmented anatomy, and
acquisition parameters are not among them and need SQL. There is no rate limit or quota. **Use
v3 only:** V1 and V2 are superseded and scheduled for shutdown, so port any `/v1/`- or
`Modality_btw`-style example a user brings rather than extending it.

Both sides build on `idc-index-data`, so compare the API's `idc_index_data_version` against local
`idc_index_data.__version__` before mixing them: the **major is the IDC data release** (`24.x.y`
serves `v24`), so differing minor/patch means the series are identical. If the API is a whole
release ahead, `idc-index` **cannot download the extra series** — it silently skips what its own
index does not list — so either upgrade it (run `scripts/check_version.py` for the right command)
or transfer directly from the bucket with `s5cmd --no-sign-request`.

See `references/rest_api_guide.md` for the endpoint reference, filter grounding, limits, and the
manifest-based download flow.

**Cloud storage organization**

All DICOM files live in public buckets mirrored between AWS S3 and GCS, organized by CRDC UUIDs
(not DICOM UIDs) to support versioning, as `<crdc_series_uuid>/<crdc_instance_uuid>.dcm`. Access
is free (no egress fees) via AWS CLI, gsutil, or s5cmd with anonymous access; use the
`series_aws_url` column for S3 URLs. Note that `idc-open-data-cr` / `idc-open-cr` (~4% of data)
is commercial-use restricted (CC BY-NC). See `references/cloud_storage_guide.md` for the full
bucket list and UUID mapping.

**DICOMweb access**

IDC data is available via DICOMweb (Google Cloud Healthcare API) for PACS integration and
DICOMweb-compatible tools: a public proxy (no auth, daily quota) for testing and moderate
queries, or Google Healthcare (GCP auth) for production volumes. See
`references/dicomweb_guide.md`.

**Direct Parquet access**

The idc-index metadata tables are also published as Parquet on a public GCS bucket
(`idc-index-data-artifacts`), queryable with DuckDB or pandas. This needs DuckDB installed
and cannot reach the per-collection clinical tables, so prefer REST `/sql` for ad-hoc metadata;
choose Parquet to pin a data version or for results past the REST row cap. See
`references/parquet_access_guide.md`.

## Core Capabilities

The patterns below are the ones that go wrong when recalled from memory rather than checked.
Worked examples for each area live in the reference guides named inline.

### 1. Discovery — enumerate values before filtering on them

Filtering on a guessed `Modality` or `BodyPartExamined` string is the most common cause of an
empty result set. Enumerate first:

```python
modalities = client.sql_query("""
    SELECT DISTINCT Modality, COUNT(*) as series_count
    FROM index
    GROUP BY Modality
    ORDER BY series_count DESC
""")
print(modalities)
```

The same pattern works for any filter column, optionally narrowed by another —
`BodyPartExamined` within a `Modality`, `Manufacturer`, `collection_id`. On the REST path this
grounding is a single call — `GET /attributes/{attr}/values` returns values with counts — and the
cohort endpoints report a miscased value in `warnings` rather than as an empty result.

Two indices carry curated collection-level metadata the primary `index` does not, both
requiring `client.fetch_index(...)` first: `collections_index` (cancer types, tumor locations,
species, subject counts) and `analysis_results_index` (derived datasets — AI segmentations,
expert annotations, radiomics — with their source collections and modalities).

**Cancer type lives in `collections_index.cancer_types`, not in `index`** — filtering by
cancer type requires a join:

```python
client.fetch_index("collections_index")
results = client.sql_query("""
    SELECT i.collection_id, i.PatientID, i.SeriesInstanceUID, i.Modality
    FROM index i
    JOIN collections_index c ON i.collection_id = c.collection_id
    WHERE c.cancer_types LIKE '%Breast%'
      AND i.Modality = 'MR'
    LIMIT 20
""")
```

`client.sql_query()` returns a pandas DataFrame. Confirm column names with
`client.get_index_schema('index')` or `client.indices_overview` before writing a query rather
than assuming them.

See `references/sql_patterns.md` for filter-value discovery, annotation and segmentation
queries, size estimation, clinical linking, and version tracking ("what's new in vX" — use
`series_init_idc_version` / `series_revised_idc_version` in `index`, never
`prior_versions_index`).

### 2. Downloading DICOM files

**The two download methods take their first two arguments in opposite order.** This is the
most common source of broken IDC code — check it rather than recalling it:

| Method | First arg | Second arg | Use when |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `download_from_selection` | `downloadDir` (required) | filter kwargs (optional) | Filtering by collection, patient, study, or series |
| `download_dicom_series` | `seriesInstanceUID` (required) | `downloadDir` (required) | Downloading specific series by UID only |

**`download_from_selection` takes filter keyword arguments, NOT a DataFrame.** The name
"from_selection" refers to filtering the IDC index by criteria — not to accepting a pandas
DataFrame. To download query results, extract the UIDs into a list first:

```python
# Step 1: Query for series UIDs
series_df = client.sql_query("""
    SELECT SeriesInstanceUID
    FROM index
    WHERE Modality = 'CT'
      AND BodyPartExamined = 'CHEST'
      AND collection_id = 'nlst'
    LIMIT 5
""")

# Step 2: Extract UIDs as a list from the DataFrame
uids = list(series_df['SeriesInstanceUID'].values)

# Step 3: Pass the list to download_from_selection (NOT the DataFrame itself)
client.download_from_selection(
    downloadDir="./data/lung_ct",
    seriesInstanceUID=uids       # list of strings, not a DataFrame
)

# Alternative: download_dicom_series has seriesInstanceUID as FIRST arg (different order!)
client.download_dicom_series(
    seriesInstanceUID=uids,      # FIRST arg here
    downloadDir="./data/lung_ct"
)

# Whole collection: downloadDir is still the FIRST positional argument
client.download_from_selection(downloadDir="./data/rider", collection_id="rider_pilot")
```

Both methods default to AWS; pass `source_bucket_location="gcs"` to pull from Google Storage.

**Downloaded files are named `<crdc_instance_uuid>.dcm`, not by SOPInstanceUID.** The DICOM
UIDs are preserved inside the file metadata, not in the filename. Use the `crdc_instance_uuid`
column to map files back to the series they came from.

`idc download <collection|series-uid|manifest> --download-dir ./data` does the same from a
shell. See `references/cli_guide.md` for the `dirTemplate` hierarchy options (Python default:
`%collection_id/%PatientID/%StudyInstanceUID/%Modality_%SeriesInstanceUID`; `dirTemplate=""`
flattens), manifest downloads with resume, and dry-run size estimation.

### 3. Visualizing IDC images

```python
viewer_url = client.get_viewer_URL(seriesInstanceUID=uid)        # one series
viewer_url = client.get_viewer_URL(studyInstanceUID=study_uid)   # all series in a study
```

Returns a browser URL — nothing is downloaded. The method selects OHIF v3 for radiology or
SLIM for slide microscopy automatically. Viewing by study is useful when a single DICOM Study
holds several Series (T1, T2, and DWI from one MRI session).

### 4. Licenses and citations — obligations, not optional steps

IDC data carries license terms and attribution requirements that follow it into any downstream
publication or product, and neither is inferable from the pixel data. **Check the license
before use, and generate citations for whatever you download.**

```python
# License breakdown for a selection
licenses = client.sql_query("""
    SELECT DISTINCT collection_id, license_short_name,
           COUNT(DISTINCT SeriesInstanceUID) as series_count
    FROM index GROUP BY collection_id, license_short_name
""")

# Citations for the same selection you downloaded (APA by default)
for citation in client.citations_from_selection(collection_id="rider_pilot"):
    print(citation)
```

About 97% of IDC data is CC BY (commercial use allowed with attribution) and about 3% is
CC BY-NC (non-commercial only). **Licenses attach to series, not collections** — 39 of 176
collections carry more than one — so check the selection you actually intend to use, and note
that the most restrictive term governs a mixed cohort.

Both tasks are available from all three access paths, so stay on whichever one the session is
already using: `idc-index` as above, `POST /v3/licenses` and `POST /v3/citations` over REST,
or the `get_licenses` and `get_citations` MCP tools. See
`references/licensing_and_citation.md` for the full license inventory, all three routes, the
citation formats (APA, BibTeX, CSL JSON, RDF Turtle), and what to include when publishing.

### 5. Reaching past the index

Pick the access path with the routing gate in *Overview*; *Data Access Options* above is the
full routing table.

Before reaching for BigQuery (which needs a billing-enabled GCP account), check whether a
specialized index table already has the column you want: search `client.indices_overview`,
then `client.fetch_index(...)` and query locally for free. BigQuery is required only for
private DICOM elements, per-segment anatomy (`segmentations`), and pre-extracted SR
measurements (`quantitative_measurements`, `qualitative_measurements`) — these have no
idc-index equivalent.

## Best Practices

- **Check schema before writing queries** — Use `client.get_index_schema('index')` (reads cached metadata, no SQL executed) or `client.indices_overview` to see all available columns and their descriptions. The version-tracking columns `series_init_idc_version` and `series_revised_idc_version` in the main `index` table directly answer "what's new / when was this added" questions without touching `prior_versions_index`.
- **Never use web search for IDC data content questions** - Always query the IDC index directly, via `client.sql_query()` locally or `POST /v3/sql` over HTTP. Web sources (release notes, blog posts, documentation pages) are frequently out of date and will produce incorrect answers. The index is the authoritative source; use it even when web search is available.
- **Verify the IDC data version at the start of a session** - `client.get_idc_version()`, `GET /v3/version`, or the MCP `get_idc_version` tool, depending on the path in use (currently v24). For a stale local index, run `scripts/check_version.py` and use the upgrade command it prints
- **Check licenses and generate citations** - Query `license_short_name` and respect CC BY vs CC BY-NC terms; use `citations_from_selection()` to produce citations from `source_DOI` for publications
- **Explore small, then commit** - Use `LIMIT` (or a low `max_rows`) while exploring, and check collection size before downloading — some collections are terabytes. See `references/cli_guide.md`
- **Keep downloads reproducible** - Organize with `dirTemplate` (e.g. `%collection_id/%PatientID/%Modality`) and save the Series UIDs or manifest behind any dataset you build

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'idc_index'`**
- **Cause:** idc-index package not installed
- **Solution:** If the task is read-only metadata, do not install it — use the REST API instead (*Data Access Options*). Otherwise run `scripts/check_version.py` and use the install command it prints, which targets the running interpreter and pins the vetted version. For data analysis also add pandas, numpy, and pydicom (tested with pandas>=1.5, numpy>=1.23, pydicom>=2.3)

**Issue: Download fails with connection timeout**
- **Cause:** Network instability or large download size
- **Solution:** Download in smaller batches (10-20 series); see `references/cli_guide.md` for
  `--use-s5cmd-sync` resume and retry guidance

**Issue: `BigQuery quota exceeded` or billing errors**
- **Cause:** BigQuery requires billing-enabled GCP project
- **Solution:** Use idc-index mini-index for simple queries (no billing required), or see `references/bigquery_guide.md` for cost optimization tips

**Issue: Series UID not found or no data returned**
- **Cause:** Typo in UID, data not in the current IDC version, or wrong field name
- **Solution:** Test with `LIMIT 5` first, check field names against `client.indices_overview`,
  and confirm the series is in the current version (some old data is deprecated)

**Issue: Column not found in `index` table (e.g., `SliceThickness`, `PixelSpacing`, `KVP`, `EchoTime`, `InjectedDose`)**
- **Cause:** The `index` table contains series-level metadata only; modality-specific acquisition and reconstruction parameters live in dedicated tables (`ct_index`, `mr_index`, `pt_index`)
- **Solution:** Search `client.indices_overview` for the column to find its table — the loop is under *Finding which table contains a column* in `references/index_tables_guide.md` — then fetch and join on `SeriesInstanceUID`:
  ```python
  client.fetch_index("ct_index")
  result = client.sql_query("""
      SELECT i.SeriesInstanceUID, i.Modality, c.SliceThickness, c.KVP, c.PixelSpacing_row_mm
      FROM index i
      JOIN ct_index c USING (SeriesInstanceUID)
      WHERE i.collection_id = 'your_collection'
  """)
  ```

**Issue: Downloaded DICOM files won't open**
- **Cause:** Corrupted download, or an object type the viewer does not handle — SEG, RTSTRUCT,
  SR, and slide microscopy all need specialized tools
- **Solution:** Check `Modality` and `SOPClassUID` first, validate with
  `pydicom.dcmread(file, force=True)`, try another viewer (3D Slicer, QuPath for pathology),
  then re-download
