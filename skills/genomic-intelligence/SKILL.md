# Genomic Intelligence — DNA Sequence Models

Genomic Intelligence (GI) serves transformer DNA language models over six
sequence-analysis tasks on managed GPUs. Give it a **gene symbol**, a **genomic
region**, or a **DNA/FASTA sequence**; it returns structured predictions —
promoter regions, splice sites, enhancer activity, chromatin state, expression
(log TPM), and de-novo gene annotation. Nothing runs locally: no model weights,
no GPU, no heavy Python stack. It is a thin client over a hosted, versioned
inference API.

**Official docs:** [docs.genomicintelligence.ai](https://docs.genomicintelligence.ai) ·
REST contract at [api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/openapi.json](https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1/openapi.json) ·
hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.genomicintelligence.ai/mcp`

## When to use this skill

Use GI when the user has DNA and wants a model prediction:

- **Find promoters** in a genomic region (`promoter`)
- **Predict splice** donor/acceptor sites (`splice`)
- **Score enhancer activity** — developmental & housekeeping (`enhancer`)
- **Annotate chromatin state** across hundreds of tracks (`chromatin`)
- **Predict expression** as log(TPM+1) from a sequence + cell-type context (`expression`)
- **Annotate genes/transcripts** de novo, no reference needed (`annotation`)
- **Find the genes in a region and predict each one's expression** (composite)

Not for local alignment, variant calling, or file I/O — use a local tool
(BioPython, bcftools) for those. GI is for **model inference from sequence**.

> For research and development use, **not clinical or diagnostic decisions**.

## Two ways to call GI

### Hosted MCP server (best for AI agents — keyless)

GI hosts an MCP server at `https://mcp.genomicintelligence.ai/mcp` (Streamable
HTTP). When your agent host supports MCP, prefer it: it works **keyless** against
a capped public demo quota (zero setup), and an optional `gi_` bearer key raises
the quota. It exposes acquisition tools that return a **sequence handle**
(`sequence_ref`) and `predict_*` tools that take that handle — so large sequences
never bloat the context. See [MCP workflow](#mcp-workflow-handle-based) below and
`references/mcp.md`.

### REST API (universal)

Plain HTTP with `requests` against `https://api.genomicintelligence.ai/v1`. The
REST path **requires** a `GI_API_KEY` (a `gi_` bearer). Use it on any host, in
scripts, or when you need the raw envelope. See [Core REST workflow](#core-rest-workflow).

## Access and authentication

1. The **hosted MCP demo is keyless** — try it with nothing set.
2. The **REST `/v1` API needs a key**, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
   Request one at [contact@genomicintelligence.ai](mailto:contact@genomicintelligence.ai).
3. **Never hardcode the key.** Read it from the `GI_API_KEY` environment variable
   (or a `.env` via `python-dotenv`). Never commit keys.

```bash
export GI_API_KEY="gi_yourkeyhere"     # optional for MCP; required for REST
export GI_BASE_URL="https://api.genomicintelligence.ai"   # override for staging
```

Keys are scoped to a partner tier with concurrency and per-minute caps. A `429`
means you hit a cap — back off and retry, or ask GI to raise your tier.

## The six tasks

All REST tasks share one shape: `POST /v1/tasks/{task}/predict` with body
`{sequence, sequence_name, model?, options?}`, returning a `{data, meta}`
envelope. What differs per task:

| Task | Mode | Length bound | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `promoter` | sync | 1–500,000 bp | sliding-window promoter regions |
| `splice` | sync | 1–500,000 bp | donor/acceptor sites (long-context BigBird) |
| `enhancer` | sync | 1–500,000 bp | dev + housekeeping scores (DeepSTARR, *Drosophila*) |
| `chromatin` | sync | 1–500,000 bp | hundreds of tracks (DeepSEA) |
| `expression` | sync | **exactly 9,198 bp** | log(TPM+1); needs a cell-type `description` |
| `annotation` | **async** | 1–500,000 bp | de-novo transcripts; submit + poll |

**Omit `model` and the API uses the task's default** — that is the recommended
call. Default model IDs are intentionally **not** documented here: defaults
change and retired IDs fail hard, so never hardcode one. To pin a model, or to
pick a non-human one (Drosophila, yeast, and Arabidopsis models exist for several
tasks), discover IDs at call time with `GET /v1/tasks/{task}/models` (REST) or
`list_models` (MCP) — and **never invent one**. Full per-task output shapes are
in `references/tasks.md`.

Two hard rules the model enforces:

- **`expression` needs exactly 9,198 bp**, a window **centred on the TSS**
  (4,599 upstream + TSS + 4,598 downstream). Any other length is rejected. Use the acquisition helpers below to
  build it — do not truncate by hand.
- **`expression` needs a `description`** — a cell-type / assay string (e.g.
  `"K562 cells"`), passed as `options.description`.

## Sequence acquisition

You rarely start from a raw 9,198 bp string. Acquire sequence first:

- **From a gene symbol** → MCP `fetch_ensembl_sequence(gene=...)`; **from
  coordinates** → `fetch_region(region=...)`. Both fetch public Ensembl reference
  sequence (no key). REST users can query Ensembl REST directly. (`find_genes` is
  the annotation task, not an acquisition tool.)
- **For `expression`** → use the TSS-centred fetch so the window is exactly
  9,198 bp. MCP: `fetch_gene_for_expression` (handles the centring). Do not
  build the window by hand.
- **From a local FASTA** → MCP `store_inline_sequence`, or read the file yourself
  for REST. (`load_local_fasta` exists only in local deployments, not on the
  hosted server.)
- **A demo sequence** → MCP `load_demo_sequence(name=...)` returns a ready handle
  (great for a keyless smoke test); `name` is required.

See `references/sequence-acquisition.md` for the exact Ensembl calls and the
expression-window math.

## Core REST workflow

Sync tasks (promoter, splice, enhancer, chromatin, expression) are one call:

```python
import os, requests

BASE = os.environ.get("GI_BASE_URL", "https://api.genomicintelligence.ai")
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['GI_API_KEY']}"}

def predict(task, sequence, sequence_name, model=None, options=None):
    body = {"sequence": sequence, "sequence_name": sequence_name}
    if model:   body["model"] = model
    if options: body["options"] = options
    r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/{task}/predict", headers=HEADERS, json=body)
    r.raise_for_status()          # 400 invalid; 401 no/bad key; 413 too long; 429 rate limit
    return r.json()               # {"data": {...}, "meta": {...}}

# Promoter:
out = predict("promoter", seq, "TP53_region")
print(out["data"]["summary"])

# Expression — exactly 9,198 bp + a cell-type description:
out = predict("expression", tss_window_9198bp, "HBB",
              options={"description": "K562 cells"})
print(out["data"]["prediction"]["expression_log_tpm"])
```

### Async: annotation

`annotation` is submit-then-poll. Send `Prefer: respond-async`, get a `job_id`,
poll until terminal:

```python
import time

r = requests.post(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/annotation/predict",
                  headers={**HEADERS, "Prefer": "respond-async"},
                  json={"sequence": seq, "sequence_name": "TP53"})
r.raise_for_status()              # 202 Accepted
job_id = r.json()["data"]["job_id"]

while True:
    j = requests.get(f"{BASE}/v1/tasks/jobs/{job_id}", headers=HEADERS)
    if j.status_code == 200:      # terminal: body is the final {data, meta}
        break
    j.raise_for_status()          # 202 = still running (2xx, won't raise)
    time.sleep(5)                 # ~20 s typical for ~20 kb
transcripts = j.json()["data"]["transcripts"]
```

## MCP workflow (handle-based)

On an MCP host, acquire a handle, then predict against it — sequences stay out of
the context:

```
# 1. Acquire a sequence handle (each returns a sequence_ref):
load_demo_sequence(name="promoter_tp53")  # keyless smoke test; `name` is REQUIRED
fetch_ensembl_sequence(gene="TP53")       # gene symbol or Ensembl ID -> handle
fetch_region(region="chr11:5,225,000-5,235,000")   # coordinates -> handle
fetch_gene_for_expression(gene="HBB")     # TSS-centred 9,198 bp handle for expression

# 2. Predict against the handle:
predict_promoter(sequence_ref=<ref>)
predict_expression(sequence_ref=<ref>, description="K562 cells")
predict_splice(sequence_ref=<ref>)        # + predict_enhancer / predict_chromatin

# 3. Annotation on MCP is `find_genes` (there is no predict_annotation).
#    It takes a handle, not a region, and runs async internally:
find_genes(sequence_ref=<ref>)            # wait=True (default) returns the result
find_genes(sequence_ref=<ref>, wait=False)  # -> job_id; poll get_job(job_id)

# Discover models with list_models(task); reference context lives in the
# gi://models, gi://docs/tasks, and gi://account MCP resources.
```

## Composite: find genes, then predict expression

To answer "what genes are in this region and how are they expressed?", use the
composite:

- **MCP:** `find_genes_and_predict_expression(sequence_ref=..., description=...)`
  — takes a **handle, not a region** (acquire one with `fetch_region` first);
  `description` is required. Finds genes in the sequence and returns an
  expression prediction for each.
- **REST:** call gene discovery, then loop `expression` per gene (build each
  TSS-centred 9,198 bp window via the acquisition helpers).

## Errors

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid request / bad sequence | Check the body; expression must be exactly 9,198 bp and carry `description` |
| 401 | Missing/invalid key (REST) | Set `GI_API_KEY`; or use the keyless MCP demo |
| 413 | Sequence too long | Stay within the task's length bound (≤500,000 bp) |
| 429 | Rate / concurrency cap | Back off and retry; ask GI to raise your tier |
| 422 | Validation failed (`validation_failed`) | The most common failure: expression not exactly 9,198 bp, or a sequence below the model's minimum length |
| 5xx | Server error | Retry; if persistent, contact support |
