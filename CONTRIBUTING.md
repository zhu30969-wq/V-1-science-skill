# Contributing Skills

Thanks for helping improve Scientific Agent Skills. This guide explains how to add or update a skill in this repository while following the open [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

Participation in this project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to Contribute

- Add a new scientific package, database, platform, workflow, or research method skill.
- Improve an existing skill with clearer instructions, current APIs, better examples, references, or scripts.
- Fix outdated examples, broken install steps, security issues, or documentation gaps.
- Add or extend a skill's tests under `tests/<skill-name>/` (see [Tests](#tests)).
- Report bugs or request new skills through GitHub Issues.

## Skill Location

All repository skills live under `skills/`. The repository root is also an
[Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org/) package: keep root `plugin.json` schema-valid, do not
add non-portable top-level fields, and keep its `version` in sync with `pyproject.toml` whenever
you bump the collection version.

```text
plugin.json
skills/
└── skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── references/
    ├── scripts/
    └── assets/
```

Only `SKILL.md` is required. Use optional directories when they make the skill easier to maintain:

- `references/` for longer documentation that agents should read only when needed.
- `scripts/` for executable helpers, validators, or reusable workflow code.
- `assets/` for templates, static resources, or example data.

Those four are the only directories a skill may contain. Anything else — tests, fixtures, scratch data, generated output — belongs outside `skills/`.

Keep references one level deep from `SKILL.md` where possible, and keep the main `SKILL.md` concise. The Agent Skills specification recommends keeping `SKILL.md` under 500 lines and using progressive disclosure for longer material.

A skill directory holds only what an agent loads, so tests do not belong there. They live in the repository-level suite under `tests/<skill-name>/`, mirroring the skill directory name, with any fixtures in `tests/<skill-name>/fixtures/`. See [Tests](#tests).

## Required Skill Format

Every skill must be a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions.

Use this minimum template:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of what the skill does and when an agent should use it.
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  skill-author: Your Name
---

# Skill Title

### Frontmatter Requirements

Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) and this repository's conventions:

- `name` is required, must match the parent directory name, and must be 1-64 characters.
- `name` may contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- `name` must not start or end with a hyphen and must not contain consecutive hyphens.
- `description` is required, non-empty, and must be at most 1024 characters.
- `description` should explain both what the skill does and when an agent should use it.
- `metadata.version` is required in this repository, even though `metadata` is optional in the upstream spec.
- Version values must be quoted numeric strings, such as `"1.0"` or `"1.1"`.
- **Only the six fields defined by the specification are allowed** at the top level: `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`, and `metadata`. The spec defines a closed set and the reference validator rejects any other top-level key, so everything else belongs under `metadata`.
- **Write `metadata` as a block mapping, not single-line JSON.** The reference validator parses frontmatter with `strictyaml`, which rejects JSON-style flow mappings. A flow mapping does not merely fail one check — the entire frontmatter fails to parse, so `name` and `description` become unreadable and the skill does not register.

  ```yaml
  # Wrong -- breaks the reference validator
  metadata: {"version": "1.0", "skill-author": "K-Dense Inc."}

  # Right
  metadata:
    version: "1.0"
    skill-author: K-Dense Inc.
  ```

Optional frontmatter fields from the specification may be used when relevant:

- `license`: the license for the individual skill, if different or worth stating explicitly.
- `compatibility`: environment requirements such as Python version, system packages, agent host, or network access. Maximum 500 characters.
- `metadata`: additional metadata, as a block mapping of string keys to string values. Quote any value that would otherwise parse as a number, boolean, or date (`version: "1.0"`, `last-reviewed: "2026-07-23"`). Common keys: `version` (required), `skill-author`, and an optional nested `openclaw` or `hermes` block (see below).
- `allowed-tools`: a **space-separated string** of tool permissions for hosts that support this experimental field, for example `allowed-tools: Read Write Edit Bash`. Not a YAML list.

### OpenClaw gating (`metadata.openclaw`)

OpenClaw reads an optional `openclaw` object nested inside `metadata` for dependency gating, credential injection, and display. Because it lives under `metadata`, the Agent Skills spec permits it and other hosts ignore it. It is only needed for skills with external requirements (credentials, daemons, specific binaries) — most skills omit it entirely.

**Keep this block a nested mapping — never a JSON string.** OpenClaw's `resolveOpenClawManifestBlock()` requires `typeof candidate === "object"`, so a stringified block silently disables gating and credential injection with no error. This is the one documented exception to the string-values rule for `metadata`, and it still passes `skills-ref validate`.

Supported keys:

- `requires`: hard eligibility gates — `{"bins": [...]}` (all must be on `PATH`), `{"anyBins": [...]}` (at least one), `{"env": [...]}` (vars that must be set), `{"config": [...]}`. A failed gate hides the skill from the agent, so only gate on things the skill genuinely cannot run without.
- `primaryEnv`: the main credential variable; OpenClaw injects it from its config (`skills.entries.<name>.apiKey`).
- `envVars`: descriptive (non-gating) declarations — `[{"name": "X_API_KEY", "required": true, "description": "..."}]`. Declare every env var your scripts reference so ClawHub's security analysis does not flag a metadata mismatch.
- `os`: platform filter, e.g. `["darwin", "linux"]`.
- `emoji`, `homepage`: display only.

Example (an API-key skill that stays available even without the key set, so it gates nothing and only declares the credential):

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  skill-author: K-Dense Inc.
  openclaw:
    primaryEnv: EXA_API_KEY
    envVars:
      - name: EXA_API_KEY
        required: true
        description: Exa search API key.
```

### Hermes compatibility (`required_environment_variables` and `metadata.hermes`)

[Hermes](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) is Agent Skills-compatible, so every skill in this repository already loads and runs there with no changes. Two optional fields make credentialed skills first-class on Hermes:

- **`metadata.hermes`** (nested, spec-safe like `openclaw`): optional classification and gating — `tags`, `category`, `requires_toolsets`, `fallback_for_toolsets`. A failed `requires_toolsets` gate *hides* the skill, so only gate on a tool the skill genuinely cannot run without; prefer leaving it unset so the skill stays available. Keep it a nested mapping, not a JSON string.

Example (an API-key skill, declaring its credential for OpenClaw and classifying itself for Hermes):

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  skill-author: Exa
  openclaw:
    primaryEnv: EXA_API_KEY
    envVars:
      - name: EXA_API_KEY
        required: true
        description: Exa search API key.
  hermes:
    category: research
```

### `required_environment_variables` is not used in this repository

Hermes also reads a **top-level** `required_environment_variables` array to prompt for credentials. That field cannot coexist with spec conformance: the specification defines a closed set of six top-level fields, so the reference validator rejects it outright — and because `strictyaml` fails the whole frontmatter block on an unknown-shaped document, the failure is not confined to that one key.

This repository therefore does not use it. Declare credentials in two spec-legal places instead:

- `compatibility` — a human- and agent-readable sentence naming the variables the skill needs.
- `metadata.openclaw.envVars` — the machine-readable declaration, which ClawHub's security analysis also checks against the variables your scripts actually reference.

Skills still load and run on Hermes; only its automatic credential prompt is unavailable, and the required variables remain discoverable from the two fields above.

## Versioning

Every `SKILL.md` must include a quoted `version` inside the `metadata` mapping:

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
```

For a new skill, start at `"1.0"`.

When updating an existing skill, increment `metadata.version` in the same pull request:

- Use a minor bump for normal improvements, for example `"1.0"` to `"1.1"`.
- Use a major bump only for a breaking change or substantial redesign, for example `"1.9"` to `"2.0"`.

## Writing a Good Skill

Good skills are specific, practical, and easy for an agent to apply.

- Write the `description` in third person with useful trigger terms.
- Include concrete workflows, commands, and examples instead of broad background explanations.
- Prefer current official APIs, docs, and installation instructions.
- Document required Python packages, system dependencies, credentials, or network access.
- Include scientific best practices, caveats, and validation checks where they matter.
- Move long API details, tables, and extended examples into `references/`.
- Use scripts for fragile or repetitive logic instead of asking the agent to recreate it every time.
- Avoid secrets, credentials, API keys, private URLs, and unpublished data.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Fork the repository and create a branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-skill-name
   ```

2. Create a new directory under `skills/` whose name matches the skill name:

   ```text
   skills/skill-name/
   ```

3. Add `SKILL.md` with valid frontmatter, including `metadata.version`.

4. Add supporting `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` only when they are useful.

5. Test any commands, code examples, and scripts included in the skill.

6. If the skill ships `scripts/`, add their tests in the repository-level suite, not in the skill directory:

   ```text
   tests/skill-name/
   ```

   See [Tests](#tests) for the layout, the path anchor to use, and how to run them.

7. Update related documentation if the new skill changes repository-level lists, examples, or setup guidance.

8. Run validation and security checks before opening a pull request.

## Updating an Existing Skill

1. Read the current `SKILL.md` and any supporting files.
2. Check upstream package, API, or platform documentation for current behavior.
3. Make the smallest useful change that fixes or improves the skill.
4. Increment `metadata.version`.
5. Test changed examples, commands, and scripts.
6. Run the skill's suite if it has one: `uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/skill-name -q`. Suites check that `metadata.version` is present and quoted, not what it equals, so a version bump never needs a matching test edit.
7. Note any behavior changes in the pull request description.

## Validation

Validate Agent Skills format with the reference validator, which is already a dev dependency:

```bash
uv sync
uv run skills-ref validate ./skills/skill-name

# or check every skill at once, the same way CI does
for d in skills/*/; do uv run skills-ref validate "$d"; done
```

CI runs this on every pull request that touches `skills/`, along with the repo-specific checks in `.github/workflows/skill-spec-validation.yml` (a required `metadata.version`, `allowed-tools` as a string, quoted `metadata` scalars, and a warning above 500 lines).

Security-scan new or substantially changed skills:

```bash
uv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner
skill-scanner scan ./skills/skill-name --use-behavioral
```

A clean scan reduces review noise but does not replace manual review.

## Tests

**Tests never live under `skills/`.** A skill directory ships only what an agent loads, so tests go in the repository-level suite instead — one directory per skill, named exactly after the skill directory:

```text
tests/
└── skill-name/          # matches skills/skill-name/
    ├── test_scripts.py
    └── fixtures/        # optional test data
```

A test reaches the skill it covers through an explicit anchor rather than a relative walk:

```python
SKILL_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "skills" / "skill-name"
```

Anything the CLIs under test resolve relative to the working directory should be repo-root relative, since the suite runs from the repository root — `tests/skill-name/fixtures/manifest.json`, not `fixtures/manifest.json`.

Run one skill's suite, or the whole tree:

```bash
uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/skill-name -q

# every skill, in a separate process each, after the repo-wide guard
uv run --with pytest python tests/run_all.py
```

Each skill's suite must run in its own process. Skills' `scripts/` directories own plain top-level module names — 32 skills ship a `scripts/_common.py`, and names like `cluster.py` and `validate_manifest.py` recur — so collecting two skills into one interpreter would resolve those imports to whichever skill was imported first and silently test the wrong files. `tests/conftest.py` rejects a multi-skill session, and `tests/run_all.py` forks per skill.

### The repo-wide guard, and what you no longer have to write

```bash
uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/_meta -q
```

`tests/_meta` is the check to run first and the one CI blocks on. It needs no scientific packages and finishes in seconds. It spans every skill at once — safe, because it parses scripts with `ast` and never imports them — and it enforces the rule this whole layout exists for: **a skill that ships `scripts/` must have a suite at `tests/<name>/` and a `[skills.<name>]` entry in `skill-requirements.toml`.** It also runs the shared structural contract over every skill: frontmatter conformance, the 500-line `SKILL.md` limit, no tests or compiled bytecode under `skills/`, every local link resolving, every script parsing, no `eval`/`exec`/`os.system`, no script shadowing a standard-library module, no hardcoded local path, and valid shell scripts.

Because `tests/_meta` already covers all of that repo-wide, a per-skill suite should not repeat it. Write only what is specific to the skill, and pull the shared pieces from `tests/_contract/`, which `tests/conftest.py` registers as the importable module `skill_contract`:

```python
import skill_contract

# every argparse script answers --help; skips when the skill's packages are
# absent, and runs for real under --isolated
CliHelpTests = skill_contract.cli.help_test_case(SKILL_ROOT)

# for scripts that are importable libraries with a worked example under
# `if __name__ == "__main__":` rather than argparse CLIs
DemoBlockTests = skill_contract.cli.demo_test_case(SKILL_ROOT, ("doe_designs.py",))
```

`skill_contract.office` and `skill_contract.schematic` cover files that several skills ship byte-identical copies of — the OOXML `office/` tree under `docx`/`pptx`/`xlsx`, and the AI schematic generator under five skills. Instantiate them against your skill root rather than writing the tests again; `tests/_meta` separately fails if the copies drift apart, so those files have to be changed together.

Guard heavy imports at module scope so a suite degrades to skips rather than a collection error when a package is missing:

```python
np = pytest.importorskip("numpy", reason="skill-name needs numpy")
```

### One environment per skill

Four suites fail on this repository's default environment because their scientific dependencies are not installed (`exa-search`, `qutip`, `scikit-survival`, `simpy`), and installing them all into one environment is not possible: the skills' upstream pins contradict each other. `opentrons` requires `numpy<2`; `esm` caps `transformers` below the release the `transformers` skill targets; `geniml` and `spikeinterface` pin `zarr<3` while the `zarr-python` skill targets 3.x; `bioservices` caps `lxml<6` while `matchms` requires 6.0.2+; and `pytdc`, `molfeat`, `deepchem`, `histolab`, `vaex`, and `ete3` each need an interpreter older than 3.13.

`--isolated` therefore gives each skill its own throwaway `uv` environment, built from [`tests/skill-requirements.toml`](tests/skill-requirements.toml):

```bash
python tests/run_all.py --isolated                    # every suite, one env each
python tests/run_all.py --isolated qutip exa-search   # just these
```

Nothing is installed into the project environment, so `uv sync` is unaffected. Each `[skills.<name>]` entry lists the packages that skill documents and, where needed, a `python` version for that skill alone — uv downloads the interpreter on demand. Packages that cannot be installed at all (a GitHub-only SDK, a conda-forge-only library, a CUDA build) are listed under `[unavailable]` with the reason, and the runner prints them so the gap appears in the test output.

A new skill that ships `scripts/` needs a `[skills.<name>]` entry — `tests/_meta` fails without one. Use `packages = []` when its bundled tooling is standard-library only — the skill still gets a clean environment with just pytest. uv caches wheels globally, so repeat runs create each environment in milliseconds.

`.github/workflows/skill-tests.yml` runs `tests/_meta` plus every `packages = []` suite on each pull request, which is fast and needs no wheels beyond pytest. The full `--isolated` sweep is not run in CI: it builds an environment per skill, and several of them need a CUDA toolchain, a JDK, or a local MATLAB install that a runner does not have. Run it locally before a release, and whenever you change anything under `tests/_contract/`.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, confirm:

- The skill directory name and `name` frontmatter match exactly.
- The skill directory contains only `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` — no `tests/` directory and no `test_*.py` files. Tests live in `tests/<skill-name>/`.
- `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter and Markdown body content.
- `uv run skills-ref validate ./skills/<name>` passes.
- Only the six spec-defined top-level fields are present; anything else lives under `metadata`.
- `metadata` is a block mapping, not single-line JSON, and its scalar values are quoted where needed.
- Any `metadata.openclaw` or `metadata.hermes` block is a nested mapping, not a JSON string.
- If the skill needs credentials, they are named in `compatibility` and declared in `metadata.openclaw.envVars`.
- `metadata.version` exists and is quoted.
- Existing skills have a version bump when changed.
- If the collection version changes, `plugin.json` `version` matches `pyproject.toml`.
- The `description` clearly says what the skill does and when to use it.
- `uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/_meta -q` passes. This is what CI blocks on, and it catches a missing suite, a missing `skill-requirements.toml` entry, a broken local link, a leaked local path, and a `SKILL.md` over 500 lines.
- If the skill ships `scripts/`: a suite exists at `tests/<skill-name>/`, a `[skills.<skill-name>]` entry exists in `tests/skill-requirements.toml`, and `python tests/run_all.py --isolated <skill-name>` passes.
- Examples and scripts have been tested or clearly marked as illustrative.
- No secrets, credentials, private data, or unsafe instructions are included.
- Relevant official documentation is linked where useful.
- Security scanner results are clean or explained in the pull request.
